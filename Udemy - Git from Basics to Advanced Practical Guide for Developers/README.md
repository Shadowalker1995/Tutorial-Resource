#### **Description**

From this course you can learn **Git from basics to advanced concepts.**

This course created for software engineers who wants to learn how to track changes with the help of the Git. No matter what programming language you use â€“ the git is equal for everyone ðŸ™‚

There are a lot of other courses in this topic. **So, why would you choose exactly this course?** Here just a few reasons:

**â€“ Real-life cases & demo during the video lesson**

There are a lot of other courses that teached you Git. But there are only power point presentations and nice digrams. You may learn hundrends of git commands but you wonâ€™t be able to apply them in real life after that courses.

In this course we will imitate team work and work on the one project from scratch. We will review different life scenarios and online, on the video, I will show you the best way to approach varios cases.

You are going to learn enough theory to understand pracical examples and exercises. No watter ðŸ™‚ Only Git!

**â€“ Practical orientation of the course**

This is what makes this course so unique. During the course we are not talking about super abstract thing and inventing our own Git. Your focus is put on the questions that you will face with on daily basis during the software development. Thatâ€™s why this course is called â€˜Practical Guide for Developersâ€™.

**â€“ Q&A support**

The significant difference between online and offline learning process is instructorâ€™s availability. If you are in the one room with tutor he always can help you to get understanding specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer.
In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in Q&A section. In case there will be recurring questions â€“ separate video lessons will be created to show how to address issue.

***So with this course you are not just getting video materials, exercises, source code, access to fremote repository (which is still pretty cool, huh? ðŸ™‚ ) , but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.\***

**â€“ Relevant knowledge**

After our team investigated other Git courses on Udemy we realized that most of them has nothing in common with real life and best practices in IT industry nowdays. Information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date.

Feel free to check LinkedIn page of instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people acrooss all over the world (BTW most of them are from top 100 companies of the world) evaluated skills of Andrii Piatakha.

**â€“ High concentration of useful material in each lesson**

Sometimes you can notice that watching of 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching of other 30 minutes lesson.

This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson, or time when program loads) sometimes ***10 times as much (sometimes even 20)\*** as final lesson duration after video editing.

Also each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you donâ€™t need to worry about understanding this in scope of this lesson â€“ instructor will make announcement when specific topic will be covered.
