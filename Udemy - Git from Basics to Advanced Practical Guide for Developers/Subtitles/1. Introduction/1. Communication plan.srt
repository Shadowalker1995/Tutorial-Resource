00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,830
Hello, Jim, in this video, we'll discuss how we are going to communicate to make sure the cloning

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,090
process is efficient.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,610
We'll review where to ask questions, how to ask questions, and we'll review communication channels

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,390
which exist.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,250
So you could reach out to me to start with.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:22,000
I would like to emphasize the importance of establishing communication during this course, because

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,400
one of the main differences between offline and online learning is availability of the kutcha.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:34,000
When I teach offline, I can just take my students laptop and is to help him to fix, quote, understand

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,040
the root cause of the issue and help students understand better what is wrong during online learning.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,640
It doesn't work that way.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,460
So what I would suggest I encourage you to use questions and answers section as much as you can remember

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,160
that when you ask questions, you also help other students to understand learning material better in

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,230
case there will be interesting questions.

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,140
I will even make a video answers to some of those.

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,920
But to be able to answer your questions in efficient way, please put as much details to your question

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,730
as you can.

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:13,070
For example, here two examples, which describes the same issue as the first one and three.

18
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,200
Could you please help?

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,440
When I try to run this code, I have compilation error.

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,440
What should I do?

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,470
So here are a few questions.

22
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:27,610
What is this called quote from lecture or from your homework or from examples provided when you see

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,880
compilation error, how does the error message look like?

24
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,460
And since I don't have physical access to your laptop, answering your question can take longer than

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,350
it was initially expected by you.

26
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's review the second example and we want to try to execute this code.

27
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:50,770
I see compilation error skarner cannot be resolved to a type where I should look at to fix this issue.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,350
From this message, it's clear to me that most likely you forgot to write an impact statement on the

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,500
top of your Java file, and it will be easy for me to help you with answer and code example to fix.

30
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,870
So hope you feel the difference.

31
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,020
What are the communications channels you can use?

32
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,460
I'm here to help you to find your first job in software engineering.

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,530
We can connect in LinkedIn and I can confirm your skills on your request.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,300
Why you need to use LinkedIn.

35
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,330
Recruiters in I.T. consultancy often use the social network while looking for candidates.

36
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
So feel free to add me to your network and we'll stay in touch.

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,010

to me and linked in.

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,140
My company is always looking for fresh ideas and we can think through how we can build when we in collaboration

40
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,700
Instagram.

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,680
I love Instagram.

42
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,240
We can use Instagram for informal communication, will become friends.

43
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,220
Who knows, probably in the future you will implement a new Facebook and I will be able to apply for

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,250
a job in your company or we will build something together.

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,430
I do love traveling and probably sometime in the future I will be able to meet anyone who are watching

46
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,080

51
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,590
like online streams on YouTube or something else.

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,960
You will learn this from the post or from the Instagram stories and definitely Facebook.

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,700
I don't spend here too much time and I'm replying faster in Instagram.

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,780
But in case you don't have Instagram, I'm still thinking how to reach out to me.

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,530
