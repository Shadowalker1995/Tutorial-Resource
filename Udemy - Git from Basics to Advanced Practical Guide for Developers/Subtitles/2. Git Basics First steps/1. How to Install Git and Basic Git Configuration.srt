1
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,790
And know the students today will install with you, get on your computers, I'll show you where you

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,320
can download and how you can install it on your computer after installation, I'm going to show you

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,450
basic configuration so that you will be ready for the next lesson.

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,580
Today, you will understand what repository is also in this lesson.

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,320
You will learn what is good bash.

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:34,550
And we let let's start open your web browser and type get download into the search.

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,980
Here's the website that we need.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,020
Just in case, I will leave links to the website in attachments to this lesson.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,610
So when you navigate it here, select your operating system and download the archive.

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,570
For Apple, the simple instructions how to install gate four windows.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,240
We have download special guides installer.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,310
Let me walk you through it.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,230
Nable left clicks.

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,540
I agree with public license.

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,400
It is free for commercial use too, so don't worry about using it.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,010
In commercial projects you have to select components that are needed to be installed.

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,990
You can keep the false selection.

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,490
Just a few words here.

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,420
Here is very convenient explorer integration for Windows.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,540
In any place of your file system you can press right.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,440
Click and open.

22
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,870
Get back or get gui get.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,450
Bush is a special application for Microsoft Windows, which provides possibility to use good command

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:32,840
line.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,650
Bush is a popular shell on Linux and Mac OS.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,230
A Shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system.

27
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,800
In other words, Get Basche is a convenient way to have Linux like terminals that supports majority

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,130
of Linux Shell comments like file creation, copy of the file and lots of other things to interact with.

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,970
Git program get go as a separate program that provides user with graphical user interface to create

30
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:09,020
new repositories, clone repositories at to stage, commit and do other operations in more interactive

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,590
and intuitive manner rather than in git command line.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,680
Later in the course we are going to run different apps that will help you to interact with get in more

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,700
intuitive way.

34
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,840
Almost all code EDS for different programming languages supports basic buttons that allows you to work

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,440
with GIT.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,260
But I strongly believe that each developer should learn how to work with git bash because with the help

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,040
of fancy GUI application where often you can't perform all operations that you want to perform because

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,890
there is no exactly that button that you need.

39
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,130
And moreover, before you will press different button in desktop, get applications, you have to know

40
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,820
what this button for and the best way to learn it is to work with it was help to get back for a while.

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,360
Get large file storage is a pretty cool thing.

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,960
This is an extension that reduces the impact of large files in your repository by downloading the relevant

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,890
versions of them.

44
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,220
Lezley, that means it will download extremely huge files only when you will need them.

45
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,150
Let's keep this selected and another to checkboxes here is to associate good configuration files.

46
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:28,670
Was a default text editor and associate as H files to be run with bosz files with extension S.H. Ashwell

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,140
scripts that are used in many variations of Unix like operating systems.

48
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,570
I believe now we can click next.

49
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,590
At least now you know what you have selected here.

50
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,780
You have to choose the full text editor.

51
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,740
I have notepad plus plus installed on my computer.

52
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,260
That's why I didn't suggest it.

53
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,230
But you can choose any other text editor.

54
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,530
You're going to need a text editor in some rare cases when you want to use special comments to leave

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,450
content message with the help of command line or during the comments manipulation.

56
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,430
Anyway, I will show you how to change the full text editor whenever you want.

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,700
So don't worry about this and press next.

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,160
Keep this radio button selected.

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:19,190
It tells you that it will adjust your pass variable so that you can use it in your standard Windows

60
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,750
Command prompt use open SSL library and click next.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,850
This configuration asks you whether you want to convert line endings and you probably already know Newline

62
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,600
character is different in Windows and Linux based systems.

63
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,050
Windows often still use carriage return and line in text files to start a your line.

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,840
That's what C RLF stands for in Unix based systems.

65
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,360
Mostly used only Lindfield character.

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,300
You can change it if you wish, but for the cross platform development, when team members use different

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,900
operating systems, the first radio button is recommended.

68
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,160
Click next.

69
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,050
Here, we need to select the.

70
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:10,380
Emulator for terminal, I recommend Torleif mean w why can you need to choose a default behavior of

71
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,950
gatepost?

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,480
What is getable?

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,910
Fastforward Mirch and rebate's.

74
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,950
We are going to learn on the next lessons.

75
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,760
This configuration also possible to change after installation.

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,440
Leave default here and click next to store your credentials and manage them in an efficient manner.

77
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,370
You can use git credential manager.

78
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:37,140
I recommend keeping this radio button selected and able filesystem Cashen that should increase performance

79
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,710
of the gate.

80
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,090
You can skip this one and live it unchecked and now just press install button that said.

81
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,190
Now, when you install the gate open file explorer in any place, click mouse, right, click.

82
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,540
You're going to see bushier option, click on it, and here is your kid Bash.

83
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,900
Congratulations.

84
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,650
Now, the first thing we need to do is to target who we are.

85
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,030
Every snapshot of the file system contains information about the author of The Snapshot.

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,270
Probably this was done to easily identify who broke system or who created the defect in the application.

87
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:25,590
But nevertheless, without telling you who you are, you won't be able to commit changes yet allows

88
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,770
you to set configuration on three different levels, system configurations that will be applied to all

89
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,700
users on your computer and all their repositories, global conflicts that will be applied to all the

90
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,750
repositories on your computer for the current user and local conflicts that will be applied only to

91
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,110
the current repository.

92
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,610
What you need to remember is that values on the lower level overrides values of the upper level.

93
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,420
For example, values that are set in local conflicts will override values from system conflicts because

94
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,910
they are more specific TSAs more important, probably.

95
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,600
You're interested what a repository is because we are using such term.

96
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,970
But I didn't explain.

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,090
What does it mean?

98
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,890
I get Repository is a get folder inside the project.

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,940
The repository contains multiple files with configuration and current project history to track all changes

100
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,050
made to files in project how to create a good repository.

101
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,240
We are going to learn in the next lesson, but now you understand what this term means.

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,720
Right now I suggest proceeding with git installation.

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,010
To tell you who you are, you need to perform the following commands.

104
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,680
Get config.

105
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,010
Global username and repetoire.

106
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,250
Here I said username.

107
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,770
And one more comment yet, config.

108
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:09,060
Global user email and repetoire at example, dot com, I recommend you use global FLAC here to set settings

109
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,500
for all repositories.

110
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,860
These conflicts will be applied on a global level.

111
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,340
That is awesome to check the value of the specific property you can use to get config command.

112
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,220
For example, to check username, I need to type next gate config.

113
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,930
User name.

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,400
To list all properties with values, I have to type the following gate config list.

115
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,290
And in this lesson, I promised you to show how you can change the default text editor to change it.

116
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,940
You need to type the following.

117
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,760
Get config lomo core editor.

118
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,780
C program files not paid, plus, plus not paid, plus, plus extra.

119
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,980
Instead of this text in quotes, you have to type the pass to your text editor.

120
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,770
Let's recap what we have learned today, today, we learned how to install, yet you also learned the

121
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,260
basic configuration.

122
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,530
Now you know what is good, Barsh and get gooey.

123
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:27,070
Now you understand how you can check and said get can fix on different levels, system, global and

124
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,520
local.

125
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,380
Also, you learned what a good repository is.

126
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
I believe now we can proceed with our next lesson.

127
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,160
Thanks a lot for your attention and see you in the next lesson.
