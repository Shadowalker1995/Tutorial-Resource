1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,030
Lot of the students in this lesson, we're going to talk about how you can undo things and adjust your

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,600
comments and we'll learn the basics of work and search console text.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,210
Ed, as we in this lesson on real examples.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm going to show you how you can amend last comment, how to on stage files, if needed, more, longer

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,600
to restore command and how you can use it to restore state of files.

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,780
Also, I will show you how you can use tab for out to completion and get the brush to save your time

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,940
on typing words.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,870
I will show you your basics of work in concert next week.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,460
And as usual, let's practice.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,210
I will open our project which we create.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,030
OK, imagine that we need the command, but we forgot to include one more file or another.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,620
Could change in that comment.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,910
We can easily amend the last comment, but be careful.

14
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,280
Today we are going to learn one of the few errors and get where you may lose some work if you do it

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,660
wrong.

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,560
And changes.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:15,530
We have to use the next command gate, commit double dash amand amant option takes current staging error

18
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,420
and uses it for the commit.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,260
In case you have nassan staging area and the only thing you want to change is the commit message, then

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,520
just use this command.

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,610
For example, let me show you the message of our last week long dash.

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,710
One end of the gate ignore and removed from station.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,470
That is our last message that we did on the previous lesson.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,010
OK, now let's change it yet.

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,950
Commit double dash amand.

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:55,090
I had updated word at the beginning here, text editor is opened, just to remind you, not part is

27
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:02,290
open because I said not, but as a default text editor in global conflicts here, I can change message.

28
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,620
I press control and ask to save the file and close it.

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,060
Now let's check the last comit message.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,170
And you can see that message is updated just in case not all students change the full text editor.

31
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,100
Let me show you what potentially you can see by default.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,460
It bash users with text editor.

33
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,640
So in case you didn't change the full text editor, you're going to see unusual for you, text editor.

34
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,940
Let me change my global settings to demo this.

35
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,130
Do you get config demo Desh, Global Core Editor V.

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,740
Now, let me amend it myself one more time, which is a very powerful program that supports many cool

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,380
features.

38
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,160
Unfortunately, this course is not about me and I am not joking.

39
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,280
It is really possible to pass a course for the editor to learn more about it.

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,400
But I will show you now the basics so that you could navigate here just in case you forgot to change

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,630
the full text editor.

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:12,310
First of all, for cursor navigation, you have to use the next case out to move cursor to the right

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,690
just to move cursor down h to move cursor to the left, K to move cursor up.

44
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,540
The text editor has two modes command line mode and insert mode.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,210
Let me show you on the example level of cursor after updated virt.

46
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,660
Now I need to switch to insert mode.

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,940
I need to press I key.

48
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,680
And you see here in the bottom we see insert words.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,090
That means you're in the insert mode.

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,570
Now I can use backspace and all the keys to change the message.

51
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,340
Let me remove updated and write the editor test.

52
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,970
Now I have to say file and close it to do this, I need to switch with editor in command line mode.

53
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:11,100
I press escape button, you can see that there is no more insert is written down here to save changes

54
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,690
and exit.

55
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:22,720
We I have to type next column W and Q W stands for Right U stands for Quitte Press enter.

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,310
Now let's check our current message and receive that message is changed.

57
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,320
Awesome.

58
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,980
Now you understand what I meant when I said that we text Ed will be a bit unusual for you to use.

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,370
That's why.

60
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,400
Let's return back notepad as the default text editor.

61
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:50,360
OK, now let's imagine you forget to add some changes, let me add more spaces in the source code file.

62
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,970
Then I added the staging area get at DOT.

63
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,930
And now I want to adjust my last command so that it includes the latest changes and I don't want to

64
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:18,170
change comit message what I have to do, I have to perform next command, get commit double dash meant

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,350
double dash, no added.

66
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,750
And press, and here it is, let's check our combat history.

67
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,750
You can see that checksum is changed.

68
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,700
This is important just to remember that each time you do commit or just commit checksum, it's changed.

69
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,110
Later, I will show you one real example, why it is so important.

70
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,890
Now, I'd like to discuss with you next, Tenaris, that we create a new file, images, that we have

71
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,390
some important conflicts.

72
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,850
Let's create this file, watch some important conflicts, dot the 60, also edit changes to the existing

73
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,060
source code and put some new lines here.

74
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,150
And they added old files to the staging area.

75
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,860
Yet at DOT, now let's check status status.

76
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,500
Here's a new file and here's the existing one.

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,520
And I just realized that I don't want to have the one come with changes in the hello file and important

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,470
conflicts together, because logically that should be two different snapshots.

79
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,840
How I can stage changes and remove from the staging area files that I don't need.

80
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:44,310
Always remember to read, get hints, pay attention here use get restored about Desh staged file two

81
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,020
on stage.

82
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:55,820
Let's follow this hint it restore the modish staged SAAC slash and press stop key that provides us with

83
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,710
the auto completion so we won't waste our time on typing.

84
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,150
Press enter.

85
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,920
Let's check its status and we see that kilovolt file was removed from the staging area and wasn't removed

86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
from my file system.

87
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,720
Also all changes are there on place.

88
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,950
Perfect.

89
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,510
I can create comment right now only with these changes and after that I can add to the stage a new file

90
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,290
and committed.

91
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,460
Awesome.

92
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,190
What if I want to discard changes?

93
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,750
Let's follow him from get here to discuss changes.

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,380
I have to type git restore and file name.

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
OK, let's do that git.

96
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,630
Restore a thirty slash and pressed up to autocomplete.

97
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,710
Hello World Java.

98
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,750
And now we can see that changes were averted great.

99
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:00,410
The one thing while I get the most is that everything what was committed can be recovered, even changes

100
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,830
that were done with the help of gift commitment commands.

101
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,370
Later in this course, I'll show you how you can use the travelogue to restore literally avarice and

102
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,620
what was ever committed.

103
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,380
However, the changes which should discard without committing is not possible to restore.

104
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,310
So be very careful.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
That's all what I wanted to share with you today.

106
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,560
Let's recap what we have learned today.

107
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,680
Today we learned how to amend last comment.

108
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,420
We also learned how to change can message if you want.

109
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,950
So you saw the text editor and learn the basics to work in the editor.

110
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,330
Also, we learned how to use step for auto completion.

111
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,530
Now you know how to stage some changes and how to restore state of the file to the original state since

112
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,450
the last comment.

113
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,370
That's all for today.

114
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,310
Thanks a lot for your attention and see you in the next lesson.
