18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,790
To me, I said the lowest price possible to make this course affordable for everyone.

19
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,450
Udemy has maximum length limit for free courses.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,810
I can publish free course only two hours long.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,060
That's why even if my courses are not free, they have the lowest price possible.

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:42,110
Here on Udemy, I have only one goal to grade the best and the most complete online courses that are

23
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,060
available for everyone, and I will keep creating new lessons for all my students.

25
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,430
That means no extra charges from you is required.

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,580
You will get all new lessons completely free of charge.

27
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,830
I want to say one more time.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,470
