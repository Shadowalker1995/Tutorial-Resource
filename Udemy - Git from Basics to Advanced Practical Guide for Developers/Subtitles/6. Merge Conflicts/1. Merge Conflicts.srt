00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,480
Hello, yes, students, in this lesson, you learn what most conflicts are in simple words, I will

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,420
explain in one, much conflicts could appear together, will reproduce real life scenarios, merge conflict.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,450
And what is even more interesting, I will tell you how to solve major conflicts together during the

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,920
drama.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,360
We are going to solve much conflict that will appear during the pulling from the remote repository.

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,330
And as usual, let's together give a definition to the conflict.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,290
The conflict is a specific event that takes place when it is unable to resolve differences in code between

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,760
two commits automatically.

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,220
This is a event which we can't avoid during the development in the team.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,070
Usually it may happen when two developers change in the same line of code.

11
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,320
How it can be.

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,950
For example, imagine that in our project we have some web page and developer.

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,480
No one worked on the task to implement login button and added some styles.

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:06,650
She included these styles into our HTML page and developing a number to work on the task for implementing

15
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,380
carcel on the home page.

16
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,710
Engineer number two also had to do adjustments in the home page because he wanted to include his custom

17
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,080
styles and adjust page markup a bit.

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,740
First, Engineer pushed his code to his original branch.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,130
He also created a pool request that was successfully merged.

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,710
But one second engineer tried to create a pool request.

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,590
He received an error that there are no conflicts.

22
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,060
Why?

23
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,780
Because two engineers and they did the same file home that each demo and most likely in the same lines

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,290
of code.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:47,120
And you can't understand what version of code is the latest one and the proper one, yet can't match

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,470
this code automatically.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,500
This situation is called much conflict.

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,330
What to do in this case?

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,210
In this case, conflict should be resolved manually.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,380
Engineer number two has to pull all the latest changes into his branch, investigate where exactly this

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,260
conflict is appeared and resolve it by saying resolve it.

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,630
I mean change source code and create a command that will be approved to the gate that these changes

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,340
are created intentionally and well reviewed by some engineer after much conflict.

34
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,130
As a result, the file can be merged to the master branch.

35
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,430
So today we are going to review the example, how this much conflict is created and how to solve it.

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,640
Let's start to start with I'd like to inform you that for the sake of the demo before this lesson,

37
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,080
I created this home, the HTML file in the Web content directory.

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,580
Let's take a look at it.

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,020
As you can see, this is the simplest possible HTML file with an overall text in it, nothing special

40
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,700
to not lose focus from the goal of our lesson.

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,250
This file was created in the separate branch and merged with the remote repository.

42
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,050
You already know how to do that.

43
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,840
Now imagine the developer.

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,300
One wanted to create styles for login button and pop up on the homepage.

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,470
Let's create a new branch for that.

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Yes, which was option C Geet three zero four login styling.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,650
Just for the sake of example, let's imagine that we have some styles folder where Altius has files

48
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,470
should be stored for those who are not aware.

49
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,410
Files with the Texas extension are used for styling your elements on the HTML pages.

50
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,350
This stands for Cascadian Stylesheets.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,490
OK, let me create Styles folder in my SAAC directory.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,650
Mkdir Styles.

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,830
Now let's imagine that during the task implementation developer, no one created Neuters as file was

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,260
description of custom styles touch styles again nauseousness.

55
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:55,080
Also Injinoo number one adjusted Holmwood HTML file to include this style there to reproduce the steps

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,250
that I did in this lesson.

57
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,040
You can use any text or code editor you would like.

58
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,100
For the sake of the demo, I will use Nano text editor to save time on switching between different screens.

59
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:14,400
Let me open home e-mail file to adjusted nano web content slash hamdard HDMI.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,880
Just to remind you, I always use that key for auto completion internal according to rules.

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,090
I can include TSF style on this page like this and the hat that I should put my link back with.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:38,910
The path to the text file had a link rel stylesheet HSF double dot slash styles slash again not to assess

63
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,990
and clotheslined attack and had attack is closed.

64
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,270
This is not a tumultuous assess.

65
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,600
That's why I won't stop on the things I wrote.

66
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,650
But I would like to draw attention to the lines which we changed.

67
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,620
We changed line three, four and five.

68
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,180
Remember this.

69
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,150
This is important for understanding of the conflict topic.

70
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,480
I access this file and save it now.

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,520
Add everything to the staging area, create and commit and push it to the original branch.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,600
Those are the things that we have already learned in the previous lessons.

73
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,340
Give me a few seconds here.

74
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:25,570
Get at not yet committed again and again yet Bush with option you originally a three zero for Logan

75
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,080
stylin.

76
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:33,380
Also, I can create pool requests, but the important thing right now is not to match your pool request.

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,530
Why we need to imitate case one.

78
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,380
Developer number two started implementation of his task without knowing about changes in the home.

79
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,060
Each team will understand.

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,720
Right now, let's pretend that we as the other engineer.

81
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,940
Let me let me get back to the massive branch and create new branch for my task from it gets which M.

82
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,770
Gates, which was option C, a three zero five homecourt.

83
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,520
So nice.

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,840
Now I have to create my own styles for Carasso.

85
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,750
Let me create file in styles directory take into account with each branch.

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,260
I don't have styles directory.

87
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,060
Here, let me show you this.

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,960
It is optional and you can see that Styles directory is not created yet on this branch.

89
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,460
Let me quickly created mkdir styles.

90
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:32,710
Now I can create miticides, file touch styles Carasso not to assess and now let me adjust home html

91
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,130
file.

92
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:40,160
None of content slash home dot HMO, I will put reference to my sister's file here.

93
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,450
At least, Carol Stylesheet, a triple double dose slash style slash carrousel, not Ceressus, and

94
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,670
close the attack.

95
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,430
Attack is also closed.

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,850
And you can notice that I changed lines number three, four and five, the same lines that as a developer

97
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,350
changed.

98
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,900
This is important.

99
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,490
Let me close and save this file.

100
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,040
I'm going to add all changes to the staging area.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,730
Come in then and push to the remote repository.

102
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,390
Give me a few seconds here.

103
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,460
Get at DOT.

104
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,760
You'd commit option and carrousel on the home page.

105
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,930
Get push resorption you a region key, a three zero five home Carasso.

106
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,400
Now imagine that during implementation of the home Carasso task pool request for logging's talent was

107
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,730
matched by a technique.

108
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,040
Let me merge it.

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,890
OK, it is merged and nothing bad happened.

110
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,490
Now let me create a pool request for carrousel implementation.

111
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,120
First of all, I see here warning that this branch can't be automatically merged, but still I can create

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,930
a pull request.

113
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,950
And after I created a request, I see that my emerge button is disabled because of the conflicts you

114
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,860
can see in here that you can solve conflicts in the Web editor, while this can be an option in case

115
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,570
of the resolving of the small conflict.

116
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
This is not an option for the most cases.

117
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,780
Why?

118
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,950
Because of the few reasons.

119
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,060
Reason number one, most likely you have more complicated conflicts than we have now here.

120
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,960
And this is not convenient to change it in Web editor reason number two, after resolving conflicts,

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,740
you want to be sure that you didn't break anything for this?

122
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,120
You have to have your code on your local machine to run unit tests or integration tests on case HDMI

123
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,260
additon to open each HTML page to make sure that everything is OK with your markup.

124
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,320
So I will show you how you can solve conflicts on your local machine.

125
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,620
Let me get back to the Kit Bash.

126
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,010
I'm on my task home carrousel branch, as you can see here, to resolve the conflicts, I have to merge

127
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,320
a region master branch into the current branch.

128
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,000
You already know that.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,190
Merge command, merge different branches.

130
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,970
But let me show you how you can merge remote branch into the current one yet pull a region master.

131
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,520
You also learned in previous lessons that pull command, merge changes into the branch.

132
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,220
And here you can see the message that there is a conflict in this file.

133
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,090
Automatic merge is failed.

134
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,070
Let resolve conflicts.

135
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,600
I have to open in any code ed file where I have conflicts.

136
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,160
For the sake of the demo.

137
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,530
I will use Nnenna Ed in this lesson now.

138
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,090
No map content egholm not HMO.

139
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,730
And here you can find different symbols that get added to our file.

140
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,260
That is how it shows the conflicts.

141
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,170
You already know that hat is a pointer to the place where you are currently in your working directory.

142
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,840
So here you can see our version of code.

143
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,530
We want to insert carrousel to assess and here changes from the master branch that were merged after

144
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,870
implementation of task by the world number one.

145
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,790
And check some of that comment.

146
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,020
We have to adjust file after some analysis.

147
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,910
I understood that in this particular case, I want to keep my changes and changes of developer.

148
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,250
No one will see that line.

149
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,830
Three and five were the same in two versions of code, but only in line number four was different.

150
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,980
We used different sets, file names here.

151
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,350
Let me add just markup accordingly.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,530
After I'm done with changes, I exit and save this file.

153
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,630
Here in parentheses, you see mansions that I'm in the process of merging two branches also.

154
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,560
You can see that suggested to me to create the once conflicts are resolved.

155
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,520
Let's follow this advice and create a committee.

156
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,780
If you would check status with get status comment, then we would see that new file logging success

157
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,680
is already added to the staging area.

158
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,930
That's the one from the master branch where we don't have any conflicts.

159
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,240
And here is the file where we had a conflict.

160
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:07,600
Let me add it to the staging area yet at not now let's check status and we can see that all files are

161
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,540
in the staging area.

162
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,010
Now, let's create a climate gate comment.

163
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,820
I will skip the message now because for such cases get already stolen message for me, the message that

164
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,960
states that must branch is merged into the task branch.

165
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,270
Let's close this text editor and we can see that we successfully merged changes.

166
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,060
Now we need to update our branch in remote repository.

167
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,950
Let's push our changes.

168
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,180
Get Bush.

169
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,410
Now, let me refresh page with my pool request.

170
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,660
I can't rebase and merge, and I will explain why in the next lesson, but I can merge with creating

171
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,400
a new command.

172
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,620
And if you remember that in previous lesson I showed you different margined strategies and how to allow

173
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,050
different merging strategies here in the settings and the merge button section.

174
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,350
Congratulations yourself, your first merge conflict.

175
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,960
But unfortunately, we are not falling right now.

176
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,580
Best practices of keeping it historically.

177
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,560
Why?

178
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,630
Because first of all, we created separate committees during the merger and Origin Master Branch was

179
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,880
our task branch and right now we are under the risk to create one more committee for merging branches.

180
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,670
Can you imagine how our history tree will look like after all of this?

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,010
Your tax rate will be disappointed.

182
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,850
Just joking in the next lessons.

183
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,360
I will show you how to avoid this and how to keep your tax rate happy.

184
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,380
But still to understand the next lessons, you had to understand this lesson.

185
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,820
And why pull an origin master into your branch to resolve conflicts is not the best approach.

186
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,450
While this approach is still valid in some companies and in some development teams, that is not the

187
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,170
approach which I would approve in my development team and in my company.

188
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,020
Probably already aware that I am CEO of my own software development company.

189
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:08,720
And when I interviewed engineers, I paid extra attention to the experience of working with it, because

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,380
during the development of complex projects and cross-functional teams, these skills are very important.

191
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,070
I am going to create top notch software engineers from you during this course.

192
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,220
That's why I will run as a way to solve financial conflicts.

193
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,550
OK, and if we are good for the day, let's recap what we have learned today.

194
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,900
In this lesson, you learned what marriage conflicts are more over together, even we produce much conflict

195
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,560
in real life.

196
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,800
Example, you learned how to resolve marriage conflicts locally and how to manage a region must rush

197
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
into a task branch.

198
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,100
Thanks a lot for your attention.

199
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,200
See you in the next lesson.
