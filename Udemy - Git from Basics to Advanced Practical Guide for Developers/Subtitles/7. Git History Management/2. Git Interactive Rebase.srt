00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello, Jim.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,040
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how interactive remise works.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,340
Today, I will show you when and how you can use interactive free based on real examples.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,600
I will show you how you can change any message from your repository history and we'll show you how to

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,340
combine to commit into one.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,670
After this lesson, you learn how to squash it.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,640
I will share with you best practices of working with give and keep good history clean.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,190
Let's start and we will start from the example that we had in previous lesson.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,790
Imagine that the men on the task branch, you understood that you have to do one more comment.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,250
Probably you forgot to add some styles.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,920
For the sake of example, let me adjust carousel to assess file nonhostile slash carousel dot to assess.

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,580
I will just put new ones here to not spend a lot of time on modifying this file.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:03,200
I add these changes to the staging area get at DOT and now you need to include latest changes into your

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,680
branch.

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,690
What you can do.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,780
The first option, which we have already learned, and which I want to remind you is to amend the last

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,890
commit like this yet come.

18
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,350
It was optional and was optional added.

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,610
This will allow you to change your latest commit without changing commit message.

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,760
But let's pretend you didn't want to amend commit for some reasons and want to create one more comment.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,890
When you're dealing with comments that were merged into your branch by a colleague of yours who doesn't

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,720
know, get as good as you are.

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,870
And that's why you have Xhaka credit for this change.

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,640
Let me create a committee now.

25
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,930
You can meet with Option M to assess class for homecare.

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,430
So Slider is added, OK, and now you have to comments on your branch.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,050
Let's add one more comment.

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,920
We need this to have at least three comments to play with on our branch.

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,580
That is for the sake of the demo, the same as before.

30
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,130
I will quickly adjust our two file and I will create one more snapshot nonhostile slash Carasso dot

31
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,840
to assess engine your lines here.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,430
You'd commit dash a dash and one Monticello's glass for home Kurzel Slider is added.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,640
OK, now we have three comments.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,180
Imagine that you are not happy with Canet message and want to change it.

35
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,470
What options do you have to adjust?

36
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:32,270
Can it get can it was option amand but what if you don't want to change economic message for the latest

37
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,660
comment?

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,090
What if you want to change economic message that goes right before the last one?

39
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,740
Interactive information will help you with this.

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,410
What is interactive freebase?

41
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,290
Interactive Freebasing?

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,820
It makes it easy to clean up your comments before they get based or moved onto another branch.

43
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:59,780
Military base was option I had to the three I stands for interactive free base, we want to proceed

44
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,410
with interactive rebates for last's recommits.

45
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,550
That's why I wrote Hand.

46
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,740
That is a pointer to our current state.

47
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,760
Delusory.

48
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,760
That means recommits back from the current one.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,680
Lets press enter now.

50
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:13,990
Awesome.

51
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,010
Here we see our three last Kummetz starting from the latest to the newest.

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,220
And I see that the change message I have to write are letter near the camp where I want to change cammed

53
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,840
message and I want to change not the last message but commit message that goes before the last one.

54
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,600
So I put our letter next to the USS Glassful home carrousel is added commit message.

55
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:46,610
I say file by pressing control and s and close the text editor in this window we can change comit message

56
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,500
as we wish.

57
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,110
Let's add more details to first class for scrolling Carasso on the home page is added.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,030
Now, let's save this file and close the text editor here, you can see notification that we successfully

59
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,820
based and updated the branch.

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,530
Let's check in with history, long story.

61
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,030
And we can see that my message for this CANET and check some of this can it was changed grade after

62
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,570
we changed the message for comment.

63
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,650
We took a look at our branch history one more time and realize that it is way too many comments about

64
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,350
the same thing.

65
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,650
We have three comments right now for the one single piece of functionality.

66
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,610
We know that in case we would put this change to the remote repository, our tech might be disappointed.

67
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,350
Why?

68
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,890
Because was the one single task grade style and focus on the home page.

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,250
We have three committees right now.

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,250
Instead of having one single command, your tablet might ask you to squash comments in order to keep

71
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,200
Guitry clean.

72
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,980
What does squash mean?

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,300
In other words, you can combine two or more commands into the one to ensure clean good history.

74
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:02,780
You can mount Kummetz so they would disappear, but not the changes which were done in scope of these

75
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,460
snapshots.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,350
Let's imagine the case that during the development of your task, you get multiple commands and after

77
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,840
that you realized that it would be better to have either one commit a group, commit in a different

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,610
manner how to do this.

79
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,000
Interactive rebase will help us also with this task.

80
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,130
Guitry base was option.

81
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,350
I had killed the three.

82
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,990
You're already familiar with this command.

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,030
You can specify as many comments backwards as you want instead of three.

84
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,410
I am specifying only three right now because we all remember four rules of happy work with Gaete.

85
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,650
From the previous lesson, I can modify only commands that are on my branch but not commit that already

86
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,980
exist and must have branch I press and at the same time in history, as we already saw today, was ablated

87
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,760
commit message.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,320
We can see that to combine commands we can use either squash or fix up.

89
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,090
Will you squash one.

90
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,730
We want to change it message and fix up one.

91
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,690
We want to keep coming.

92
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,280
The message of the first command.

93
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,430
Most likely if you combine multiple commands, you want to reflect this in the correct message.

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,120
That's why more often you're going to squash rather than fix.

95
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,860
An important thing to mention here, you can squash the first commit in the list.

96
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,390
In other words, here in the first row, you should have to be able to squash all the comments I wrote

97
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,860
as letter near to commit s stands for squash.

98
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,950
And in case you forgot, you can find other shorthands here.

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:38,510
I press control and ask to save the file and close it now and ask my I to address commit message.

100
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,740
I see the command lines and commit messages of my other comments.

101
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,150
Let me clean this up a bit and leave the one message which I'd like to keep.

102
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,860
In addition to this one I want to add a few words is styled.

103
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,230
I save the file and close it.

104
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,900
I see a message that I successfully replaced.

105
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,420
What else potentially might happen here?

106
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,530
Potentially you can see a message about much conflict during are basin similar to the one you saw in

107
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,370
previous lesson.

108
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,550
Take into account you combine comments that might be merged conflicts, but you don't really know how

109
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,530
to deal with conflicts during the invasion.

110
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,090
Since we showed this in the previous lesson, let's check our command history now.

111
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,190
Get log dash three.

112
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,610
Great, you can see our comment was updated message and pay attention.

113
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,240
You took some if checksum is different, your you know, that pushed the remote repository will be rejected.

114
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,160
Beside our audit committee here, you can see all the comments from the remote master branch.

115
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:45,100
And we can see here our chametz, where we adjusted Susanne's file because they're mounted.

116
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,020
But the changes are in place.

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,540
We can open our chasez file just to check this Nuna styles, Desh, Castle, Dot to assess and find

118
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,290
that newlines.

119
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,130
Edit editing first commit and new line so that you're in the second place.

120
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,780
We can count number of new lines, but I believe it is even visually obvious.

121
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,600
We did all we wanted and you already know that in case there is a difference between comment history

122
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,490
and my local branch and remote branch, we need to for update our remote repository and unpressed lesson

123
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,340
learned best practices.

124
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,170
And we are going to use force with at least now used brute force with less.

125
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,770
We added additional changes and combine them in one snapshot and updated our budget request.

126
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,120
This will make you happy on your future project, I promise you.

127
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,040
Now let's recap what we have learned today.

128
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,640
In this lesson we learned what interactive rebase is.

129
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,370
You learn how to start interactive replays.

130
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,850
You saw how you can change any commitments that in your repository after this lesson, you also know

131
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,800
how to combine few comments together.

132
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,580
We learned best practices of working with Gaede today.

133
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,290
That's all for now.

134
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,200
Thanks a lot for your attention.

135
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,860
See you in the next lesson.
