1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,960
And now the students in this class and we are going to discuss the topic that will be interesting for

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,510
developers who work in such integrated development environment as Eclipse, we're going to learn today

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:22,960
how to integrate it with eclipse for development come for besides buttons and widgets that will configure

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,310
an eclipse during the lesson.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,280
I will show you how you can use get Bush directly from the eclipse together on real example.

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,930
We are going to learn how to execute basic operations from Eclipse.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,900
I make overview of widgets that will allow you to see good history navigate between branches, push

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,120
and pull changes from the remote repository.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,280
After this lesson, you will learn how you can resolve conflicts in eclipse interface.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,310
Let's start and turn the topic.

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,100
I said just jump into the practice.

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,510
Here's my Eclipse workspace.

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,610
I created a completely new workspace and reset perspective for you to default to configure it with you

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,350
from scratch.

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:07,000
I have Empathies Java Project, which we did together during the learning of the get in the workspace.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,610
How to Impact Projects into Eclipse.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm going to show you in the separate lesson.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,680
Do not lose focus from the topic right now.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:22,270
When I in the Project Eclipse automatically recognised that there is a git repository and you see that

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,570
in square brackets, it is even specifying my current branch.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,420
But nevertheless, I will show you how that you get repository to eclipse manually just in case.

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,810
First of all, let's add all views here that we need.

23
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,110
Click on Window Show.

24
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,870
You are the one here git folder or use search bar to find it faster.

25
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
I would say that you'd stadion and git repositories.

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,580
Those are tools that you need.

27
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,600
One hundred percent.

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,950
Well, at least in my opinion, I'm holding control button and with a mouse left click select the options

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,550
that I need.

30
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,270
Let's also select get lock and it is good that we have learned how to work with Gatins again.

31
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,920
But at least now you already understand what all these views are about.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,110
You already know what is a staging area, what is a good red flag.

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,090
You already know what they're getting directed for basis after we selected all use we need.

34
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,500
Let's press open button.

35
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:30,110
Nice views were opened just to remind you that you can move these views wherever you like them most

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,250
here in the clips, for example.

37
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,200
Let me move git repositories widget here at the bottom with other views.

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,720
And you can see that my clips recognized each repository in my project automatically.

39
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,720
But just for the future and just in case, I want you to know how to add the existing repository to

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,330
their clips, because it might be that the clips will not automatically recognize that you have not

41
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,890
get folder in your project.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,380
And in this case you have to edit manually.

43
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,980
For the sake of example, let me remove the digital repository from this view in the clips mouse right.

44
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:11,540
Click remove repository from you because I want to remove git repository only from eclipse view and

45
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,570
I don't want to remove the don't get folder from the file system and I don't want to remove the project

46
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,450
and eclipse associated with this git repository.

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,230
I want to keep project in my workspace for you.

48
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,740
That's why I press this button.

49
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,260
Awesome.

50
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,170
Now we don't have any repository here.

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,950
You can create a new repository if you wish.

52
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,170
That is similar to executing Mutiny's.

53
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,720
Come on.

54
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,160
You might also an existing repository with the help of the eclipse wizard.

55
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,370
And in case you already have git repository in your computer, you can just add it to the workspace.

56
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,620
I believe there is no need to go over each of this option in detail because creating a good repository

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,070
is just specifying directory where you want to create don't get older and present.

58
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,510
Great Bottom Clonan Repository is just specifying the past as a repository and your credentials in case

59
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,870
you want a repository with the help of a HTTPS protocol.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,370
But from my experience, this option at an existing local repository is used most of the times by me,

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,760
and I don't know why, probably because I don't rely on the eclipse tools to manage Mangat repository.

62
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,720
Usually I fetch all projects with a simple git clone command in the git bash and after that an important

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,860
project to the eclipse and an existing local git repository.

64
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,130
Personally, for me, this option is the easiest one, but my job is to share with you all possible

65
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,570
options and let you decide what works the best for you.

66
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,010
That's why let me show you how I usually add existing local repositories to Eclipse.

67
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:53,060
And now you should specify a folder where your local repository is located and navigate it to the folder

68
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,470
that we created together during the course while learning Gaede and press select folder button here

69
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,480
clip's shows me repositories that it found in this folder.

70
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,450
I checked this checkbox and press that button and here's my repository back again.

71
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,250
Let me expand it.

72
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,430
It is very convenient to switch branches here.

73
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,120
You might find here local and remote branches nable left click on the massive branch will move me to

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,750
the master branch eclipse will ask for confirmation.

75
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,550
Just click checkout and you already know how you check out command works.

76
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,930
So I believe you understood what happened behind the scene and you may see a small T care next to the

77
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,890
massive branch name.

78
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,730
Let me switch back to the Kayseri 09 branch.

79
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,840
Right.

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,090
Click on the branch would allow you to do the operations that will want to perform in Git Bush.

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,890
You may reset branch in different modes, so it makes and hard.

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,850
You may replace your branch if needed, merged, delete, rename and perform all other operations that

83
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,440
you may perform in the git bash.

84
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,630
We don't have docs in our repository yet, so it is empty here.

85
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,100
What a task is will be discussed in the separate question here, you may find your main references in

86
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,940
your repository.

87
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,300
You may check out the if you wish in remote.

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:24,110
You may check to what remote repository you are connected right now in Stasch comments, you can explore

89
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,370
the state of your stasch.

90
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:33,050
And you're working directory, that is technically a project that may collapse everything here, based

91
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,660
on my experience, I mostly use this section to navigate between branches, create new branch if needed,

92
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,220
and remove all branches.

93
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,330
Let's move on this, Sunny, as a positive name means that I have some onstage changes you may find

94
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,750
similar.

95
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,030
Some here in the package explore how to identify what change are we talking about?

96
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,190
Let's check separate tab for that.

97
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,460
Yet, Stadion here, you can manage what is in the staging area right here, commit message and commit

98
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,490
changes if you want.

99
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,310
You also can commit and push to the remote with a single button click here.

100
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,970
From this view, I see that DOT project file is marked as unstaged changes here.

101
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,300
This is configuration of eclipse file that the groups created after we implement the project into it.

102
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,020
Let me update yet.

103
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,820
Ignore the just ignore this file.

104
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,350
I can't find it in your file in the package Explorer review.

105
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,510
But let me open the gate of you for that.

106
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,680
I click window shoe view navigator.

107
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:42,330
And this view, I can see old files as they are look like in my file system and here's Technophile,

108
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,120
let me add here DOT Project and save the file.

109
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,940
And you must use it instantly, not project file is gone from unstaged changes and to ignore it, you're

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,160
going to press this green plus sign to add all files from this section to the stage changes section.

111
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,450
That's right.

112
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,130
Commit message and troops files ignored.

113
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,840
And I can make a comment by clicking here, but probably I would commit and push changes to the remote

114
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,220
repository simultaneously.

115
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,690
To do this, I have to click on it and push button here in the desert.

116
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,290
You should set up stream branch for the current branch.

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,720
That is exactly what we did when we specified you option during the push to the remote repository.

118
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,010
Just click all these buttons until you see confirmation that your changes were pushed because the remote

119
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,030
we may check GitHub, but believe me, changes are there in the remote already.

120
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,560
Let me show you a few more things you can press.

121
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,160
Mouse, right.

122
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,640
Click on the project and you'll find a team section.

123
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,240
This section is integration with it in Eclipse.

124
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:54,570
And you might find here a lot of different options like fetch from upstream push or bold changes and

125
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,380
many others.

126
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Take your time to investigate the section and ask me in case you have any questions to check, commit

127
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,850
history.

128
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,150
You can press show in history here.

129
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,370
You may see cammed hash commit message, author of the Commit and Date of the Snapshot.

130
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,020
And this window, you can check what files were changed in scope of the particular comment.

131
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,840
You may open the file to see the difference before and after the snapshot to understand what exactly

132
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,640
was changed.

133
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,530
This is where we use a full tool during the investigation of the effects when after specific commit

134
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,880
something went wrong.

135
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,700
Also here in the history, you may reset your branch to a specific committee or check out there.

136
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,490
You just click mouse, right.

137
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,430
Click and select exactly what you need.

138
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,110
Now I want to show you a few more configurations that I found extremely helpful.

139
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,100
I want to tell you how you can add a few buttons here on the toolbar.

140
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,480
Click window perspective, customize perspective.

141
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,340
Now go to the action of ability and select it here.

142
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,100
After that, go to the toolbar visibility and make sure that it is selected here.

143
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,830
Click, apply and close, and now here on the top, you have very convenient buttons.

144
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:20,560
No matter what you want to do, push back from upstream pool, check out the branch, Rebase Mirch,

145
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,200
or he said you can start the separation's simply by clicking the right button in the toolbar.

146
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,250
And even in case you can't find is important that you need or you want to execute some specific command

147
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,540
was a specific option.

148
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,480
You always may open it feedback directly from Eclipse and start working it to open it.

149
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,290
Bushing An Eclipse finds the icon of the console in the toolbar.

150
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,620
Hear this, click on it and select it.

151
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,410
Bush in the dropdown here in the bus should be installed on your computer.

152
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,210
In either case, you won't be able to find it here in the dropdown list.

153
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,680
Now you may click OK Button and terminal is opened.

154
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,290
Important thing to mention here.

155
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,430
Always pay attention to the directory WAGGETT Bush is opened in case you have multiple yet repositories

156
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,330
in the single eclipse workspace that keeps my open you another directory or it may open your home directory

157
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,040
to make sure that eclipse will open the user right directly.

158
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:29,770
I always press the project first here and only after that I click open terminal icon homes.

159
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,140
This information will help you.

160
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,070
That is practical, deep.

161
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,620
That is really helpful to students in my opinion.

162
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,500
We didn't talk about Rafalski yet.

163
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,030
Nothing special here.

164
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,770
I believe you already learned in the separate lesson what a greater focus here.

165
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,100
You might find the red flag, if you will domus right click.

166
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,520
You can find additional options that might be useful for you.

167
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,400
And the last things that I wanted to share with you today is to show you how you can resolve conflicts

168
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,890
in eclipse, especially for that I prepared a separate branch where I reproduce, merge conflicts,

169
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,400
state how to reproduce and what merge conflict is.

170
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,650
Please feel free to learn in the separate lesson dedicated to the merge conflicts in this lesson output

171
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,760
the stress only on the eclipse tools to integrate with the grid.

172
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,540
Here is a separate branch with so much conflict in it.

173
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,390
I called the branch merge conflict dilemma.

174
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Usually when you have much conflict, eclipse highlights to your files in which you have much conflict

175
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,730
with the red dots like this.

176
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:37,600
So now it is impossible to mis file with the next conflict when we open the file, which is a good science

177
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
where I get separated for different state of the file from different snapshots.

178
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,790
But the groups offer special tool to merge conflicts in files.

179
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,760
Let me show it to you, Mouse.

180
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,950
Right, click on file game merge two here on top.

181
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,620
You are going to see Kummetz hash that have conflict.

182
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:04,150
Usually you can't edit text in the window on the right, but you can modify text in the window on the

183
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,450
left.

184
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,760
Here you can click this arrow to place everything from the right window to the left window.

185
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,490
When you are going to have more conflicts, there will be different arrows for each specific conflict.

186
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,250
And after you modify the file on the left, you can press control and ask to save the file.

187
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,370
If we would check the same file in the text editor, we are going to find that all signs that it put

188
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:27,760
here.

189
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,200
I removed grate in the gas station.

190
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,210
You can put a file to the staging area to more conflict.

191
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,430
As a result, when conflict is resolved, you may see a small asterisk on the file.

192
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,210
And after all, conflicts are resolved and there are no more red dots, you can open it.

193
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,350
Brush and continue.

194
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,940
Is a rebasing or cherrypicking something?

195
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,590
What caused the merge conflicts?

196
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,290
I believe we learned a lot today about the clips and get integration.

197
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,000
Now I want you to take your time and as much heat related violence as possible to learn the material

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,400
better.

199
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,590
The best thing to learn this is to practice as much as you can.

200
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,070
Meanwhile, let's recap what we have learned today.

201
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,240
The Navy learned how we might interact with it.

202
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,800
With the help of a glimpse, we learned what views the clips we may use to execute to give commands.

203
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:25,670
Also today, you saw how you can execute basic operations from a collapse besides the collapse configuration.

204
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,570
We also learned how to use it directly from Eclipse today, where even did can commit and push that

205
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,330
snapshot to the remote repository.

206
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,060
And in the end of the lesson, I showed you how you might use magenta in eclipse.

207
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,450
Hope you enjoyed the lesson.

208
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,900
Thanks a lot for your attention and see you in the next lesson.
