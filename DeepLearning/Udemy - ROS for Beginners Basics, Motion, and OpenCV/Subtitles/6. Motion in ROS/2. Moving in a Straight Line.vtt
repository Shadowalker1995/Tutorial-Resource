WEBVTT

00:02.310 --> 00:06.050
Also beat them such as Yes.

00:06.560 --> 00:12.330
OK so before starting writing code let me show you what is the expected final application.

00:12.350 --> 00:16.830
So this is just the illustration of what the beginning of the question.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.250
Very simple.

00:18.920 --> 00:24.720
OK so this is the start to see a long way to execute to simply note.

00:24.840 --> 00:33.090
So you can see here first it goes to this location and then it starts browsing the area and the street

00:33.090 --> 00:33.470
laughs.

00:33.480 --> 00:42.990
Now we take it straight so you can see now Silver Foxes up demand gold the gold from this point is that

00:42.990 --> 00:48.000
one and then moves away when it arrives at the corner.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.270
It has to stay.

00:49.470 --> 00:51.600
OK so here I'll take that.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.280
So I've already told you lately that we are in a developing story.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.400
So first of all I'm moved to create a cutting package workspace.

01:04.460 --> 01:05.080
OK.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.400
And then I need to combine.

01:06.470 --> 01:13.680
Then you could keep packages and let me make another decision by them to start my work.

01:14.280 --> 01:25.020
So OK so I just created this package and I need to open it so open it clicks and then it does so I can

01:25.020 --> 01:27.230
make the fresh doesn't appear.

01:27.230 --> 01:31.080
Now I can see the new package here.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.340
OK.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.040
So it is a command.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.940
And here your father folder essentially funding for putting the source files.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.040
Ok so let's do this again.

01:43.200 --> 01:50.040
So this is and you don't want to create source files that have to go wrong but

01:52.930 --> 01:53.190
you know

02:01.420 --> 02:03.610
so are looking for.

02:04.110 --> 02:11.170
So we do have to trust that each library and this is the main function.

02:11.190 --> 02:17.070
Now you should know are going to collector to seek either order or with you.

02:17.150 --> 02:17.800
Anyway.

02:20.700 --> 02:26.150
Other software used to create a note to have a reference for that.

02:26.290 --> 02:31.590
OK so my intention is to write a new method to move straight forward.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.710
OK.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.380
I don't know what street.

02:39.910 --> 02:43.340
So the first thing is not the.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.540
I'm going to check the clock method.

02:45.580 --> 02:48.520
It takes a spin a double.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.610
This is the deal.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.100
This is the distance to move.

02:52.420 --> 02:53.850
This is the direction of the robot.

02:53.890 --> 03:04.570
If it is to move forward despite the move backward and that I start the implementation of the method.

03:04.790 --> 03:13.270
And so it's going to specify a speed limit for such a distance.

03:13.310 --> 03:25.940
So you know that in physics this field is to the all the distance it will go as you might implode by

03:26.100 --> 03:26.980
time.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.610
So this is basically what we're going to use

03:37.250 --> 03:39.750
so I'm going to make it go from.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.720
No we need to publish something.

03:41.770 --> 03:44.910
So but what methods to publish and how.

03:44.980 --> 03:49.450
So first of all let me do this you know I need to underscore

03:52.800 --> 03:55.730
So this is on the scene of the.

03:58.010 --> 04:02.590
OK and not just different topics.

04:02.640 --> 04:07.930
We need to make this OK.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.210
You have three topics left.

04:09.210 --> 04:17.100
Doctor what sort of topic that we need to move the data is what we call the 1 cm demonises for comment.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.230
So let's look at user comment.

04:19.230 --> 04:22.990
What is it doing to make you stop the flow

04:26.380 --> 04:27.370
of the wind.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.940
Now I can see that there is on one subscriber that you see not the Senate but the diet or the message

04:38.210 --> 04:40.960
to be sent to this topic is the message.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.440
So let's look what is inside that message.

04:43.990 --> 04:48.290
Russ M S G Show.

04:50.270 --> 04:51.920
Ok this message.

04:52.070 --> 04:58.280
So Christmas's what these two components the city and under the velocity and each type of because it

04:58.580 --> 05:02.260
contains the attributes X Y and Z.

05:02.270 --> 05:09.550
Now since you are a two dimensional space so what matters for us is the x 4 x component and is a component

05:09.550 --> 05:10.470
of the aggregate.

05:10.550 --> 05:15.320
You can see the previous use if you want to have more detailed information about this.

05:15.320 --> 05:23.200
So the idea here is to publish this message from our you know what to make it move.

05:23.510 --> 05:28.780
So first of all we need to create a message and publish that message.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.490
So what do we need.

05:30.590 --> 05:35.010
We need a message of that German team at.

05:35.120 --> 05:41.520
And also a publisher so that you can publish that message to the subscriber that you to see.

05:41.990 --> 05:49.030
So for this to create two things First of all the method move I'm going to create this message is your

05:49.040 --> 05:50.530
medium is just me.

05:50.840 --> 05:58.260
And also I need to create a publisher for the column.

05:58.310 --> 06:03.110
So I to create a global variable for the publisher.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.120
So I'm going to get to publish that as a global variable.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.980
So these publisher need to be initialized the main function.

06:10.270 --> 06:14.380
So to get a publisher you tried to publish it equal to advertisers.

06:14.450 --> 06:19.730
This is the third method that is a top rated method.

06:19.790 --> 06:22.710
It takes the type of the message to be advertised.

06:22.850 --> 06:29.050
In this case you have to use message and the name of the topic is that the 170 vote which we funded

06:29.080 --> 06:31.180
using the last topic.

06:32.240 --> 06:38.220
OK so now our coverage is Dick Clark and also is its created.

06:38.270 --> 06:46.480
So my question now is the method that I would give it so to speak for example here I don't get it yet.

06:46.550 --> 06:48.230
The city of 2.0.

06:48.390 --> 06:52.010
What a difference what exemplified it.

06:53.540 --> 06:58.580
For example in the four words that actually so I would like to write and test this method.

07:00.070 --> 07:04.540
This the method works.

07:04.990 --> 07:09.730
So first of all I need to define what we mean by action of yours.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.660
So we created the velocity message.

07:12.690 --> 07:21.370
Are going to set the daily pounding it must be positive for one that is true and negative if it isn't

07:22.610 --> 07:24.060
in the action.

07:24.160 --> 07:29.370
So this is how you said that the evidence that Iraq is for that is before the election.

07:29.380 --> 07:35.950
I'm going to cite a positive that is of the speech was given by the debate.

07:35.980 --> 07:40.430
Do you foresee to be positive because moving forward.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.580
I mean could you be any more.

07:42.660 --> 07:50.340
Not that I need to defend the city the way I do.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.490
You don't because we're not going to move either left or right side.

07:56.050 --> 08:01.350
It's only two dimensional space facing one that actually acts.

08:02.380 --> 08:07.130
And the second is that we need to set the order in the city.

08:07.450 --> 08:08.060
OK.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.300
So what is the message.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.090
It has two components really.

08:11.560 --> 08:18.880
So here you have said the new year of the X Y and Z you get a chance and you need to do the C for the

08:18.910 --> 08:23.850
angular velocity in the x y and z that actually only say.

08:24.010 --> 08:30.410
So the value of the ballistic must be equal to zero.

08:30.550 --> 08:37.050
So as you said I wouldn't I'm going to apply that this is equal to speed multiplied by time.

08:37.210 --> 08:47.380
So first of all I'm going to take the value of time to measure the current time that I'm going to have

08:47.380 --> 08:48.440
a row.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.320
OK what do we do.

08:52.350 --> 08:56.860
We publish publish the results.

08:57.540 --> 08:58.240
OK.

08:58.510 --> 09:06.830
So I'm going to make a rule why not reach out to the inner city and

09:10.470 --> 09:14.830
the distance or the current distance much

09:17.470 --> 09:20.410
distance made

09:22.990 --> 09:33.270
by you state what you specified distance or what.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.520
Let's say it is smaller.

09:36.520 --> 09:45.100
Ortigas So this is the exact condition I'm going to make to these conditions so yea I'm going to guesstimate

09:45.100 --> 09:46.550
the distance.

09:47.210 --> 09:52.440
So to make the distance OK.

09:52.490 --> 09:57.440
But by the time you of the robot multiplied by.

09:57.770 --> 10:05.960
OK what is the current time minus the zero that is the time I have measured before that.

10:06.050 --> 10:08.710
So just give me the duration of execution.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.300
OK.

10:10.720 --> 10:18.970
And each time I publish the message I'm going to do it again the distance and then check this see the

10:18.970 --> 10:25.620
current distance that was moved by what is equal to the speed that they have set here.

10:26.060 --> 10:26.690
OK.

10:26.690 --> 10:30.990
Multiply by the difference of the current time minus the initial time.

10:31.020 --> 10:33.210
This gives Actually the time duration.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.770
So this is all we are going to do.

10:37.910 --> 10:52.020
So in order to find the initial time zero we got to use a roast method that is called Barrow's time.

10:52.820 --> 11:01.120
Now they use value object I'm going to convert it to seconds.

11:01.330 --> 11:11.920
So to settle these views double the value of the current so called Zero that

11:14.780 --> 11:25.740
I'm going to say the distance is zero because it usually isn't any anything.

11:26.530 --> 11:29.990
And finally I want to make my way to my ego.

11:30.020 --> 11:33.020
That is why.

11:33.390 --> 11:37.630
Why do I put my condition.

11:38.540 --> 11:41.330
So it is in my book just published that message.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.870
So if you remember we have already lost.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.410
We probably should be initialized.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.770
You know me.

11:47.900 --> 11:55.980
I'm going to use these global event to publish the speed of the orbit using this method.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.260
OK.

11:57.290 --> 12:05.980
And here I'm going to publish what is the message we're going to publish to get this message.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.960
Then I need to measure the distance the current distance.

12:10.990 --> 12:11.820
OK.

12:11.830 --> 12:22.300
So first of all to take the current time you want one simple question.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.220
OK.

12:25.320 --> 12:35.310
And then I can estimate the current distance moved by what it would speed multiplied by Keelung minus

12:35.520 --> 12:36.430
zero.

12:41.880 --> 12:50.730
And that is not too big the publisher if I need to make cross the once in the future I'm going to show

12:50.730 --> 12:55.980
the difference between low speed and the rest of the mass because if we don't make Rusti this should

12:56.070 --> 12:59.480
not be a leap to actually be buffer.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.680
And at the speed was Scott

13:04.300 --> 13:07.700
OK so then we need to make sure the workbook.

13:07.750 --> 13:16.300
So we are going to repeat the sheet with the policy that is going to keep moving until we get to the

13:16.630 --> 13:19.330
distance.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.180
Why.

13:20.410 --> 13:20.650
Why.

13:20.650 --> 13:24.220
Because the science is smaller than the distance.

13:24.230 --> 13:28.900
So while this is smaller than the distance I want to move.

13:28.990 --> 13:34.150
It's going to perform the role as many times as it gets.

13:34.210 --> 13:43.830
So of course it's going to do to do this I need to make a smart a small.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.720
All week do you really object.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.120
Not really.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.380
Okay.

13:52.450 --> 13:56.190
And then maybe second.

13:56.240 --> 14:06.570
So a message is sent the message is the second so you don't want one second to send that message.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.790
And then want to make the

14:13.910 --> 14:15.590
here that's the

14:24.090 --> 14:25.320
and finally the last thing.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.530
This is also important.

14:27.870 --> 14:28.450
We need

14:32.660 --> 14:41.300
we need to set the glasses back to zero so that whenever it is out of the low whenever it is out of

14:41.300 --> 14:46.550
the loop I'm going to publish zero message equities.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.870
So I'm forced to stop immediately.

14:48.970 --> 14:57.200
Otherwise we keep moving forward sometimes because it takes into the memory so when we publish we to

14:57.230 --> 14:59.510
execute a certain amount of time.

14:59.870 --> 15:06.560
But if you do it like this is going to force the robot to stop immediately its comments but this is

15:06.560 --> 15:07.170
what we want.

15:07.280 --> 15:13.470
So now we have the mobile book so we can just test it

15:17.340 --> 15:19.390
so now we are going to go it.

15:19.740 --> 15:31.680
So if I were to go to Google workspace need to make cake make of course here doesn't take into account

15:32.130 --> 15:34.400
our new application.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.390
Why.

15:35.610 --> 15:37.710
Because we did not like this into the cup.

15:37.710 --> 15:43.950
You make me so not to be able to come by OK.

15:44.100 --> 15:50.780
So here in the source directory under the same directory that is a key.

15:50.820 --> 15:59.690
So each package it has its own document list will treat all of the so we need to add one executable.

16:00.120 --> 16:12.450
So in order to go by and execute in that key workspace in the middle is this one.

16:12.830 --> 16:20.240
So here I think will anybody to know you're going to call it not.

16:20.390 --> 16:24.460
And make reference to be I would like to compile it.

16:24.570 --> 16:28.060
So we have written what about you the Mississippi.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.450
So I'm going to specify this here.

16:30.870 --> 16:31.350
OK.

16:31.390 --> 16:39.780
Then to execute when this is exit it will note that the target line.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.960
So this is too late.

16:40.980 --> 16:45.100
All the love is defined in that key to our newly created node.

16:45.540 --> 16:51.460
And this is the policy that we need whenever we have messages to be generated but for the states this

16:51.450 --> 16:54.200
is optional not just want to put it here.

16:54.300 --> 16:59.620
Now we see what I would do this I'm going to go by the being

17:03.230 --> 17:04.000
what happens

17:08.830 --> 17:09.340
here.

17:09.390 --> 17:10.370
There is a problem.

17:10.370 --> 17:14.690
There is a dependency problem of course not to fix this.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.600
To fix this we need to do the following.

17:17.660 --> 17:23.590
We first need to go to the catkin workspace of the.

17:23.650 --> 17:29.750
So to get at least OK some dependencies.

17:29.750 --> 17:34.640
So the first thing we need to add here.

17:34.820 --> 17:35.260
OK.

17:35.300 --> 17:43.180
We need to add one package in the components and leave all the packages that our application back on.

17:43.220 --> 17:51.380
So we are writing is less so because the pump on the nurses BP so articles doesn't depend on Sunday

17:51.380 --> 17:59.370
messages so it harm any movie just really just in case you could use any of the stations send the message

17:59.390 --> 18:09.320
that history like what is important is to include them as you swipe because you not included in the

18:09.320 --> 18:11.190
message is that age.

18:11.580 --> 18:12.010
OK.

18:12.020 --> 18:15.510
So the psychics must be included as the.

18:15.890 --> 18:24.430
So I we did hear in my package and also just done okay getting back page.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.070
OK.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.620
It all depends as you copy.

18:28.630 --> 18:31.800
So this is actually that well what is effective.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.640
So all of this is the other method.

18:34.960 --> 18:44.980
The other one I find the packages and your packages dependencies all these dresses the standard messages

18:45.440 --> 18:52.230
Germany Emmets Yes and message type.

18:52.270 --> 19:03.170
OK so now even if we combine in we still go to a dependency problem because we need to also look at

19:03.170 --> 19:06.660
the package for X-amount site.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.240
So how to do this

19:11.030 --> 19:20.300
we need a big dependency and drug dependency so all the slavery's must be dependencies in that be compiling

19:20.670 --> 19:22.480
or running the program.

19:22.550 --> 19:29.340
So all you need to do is to add some text file and you could you have believed the band was of the year

19:29.450 --> 19:30.570
for those files.

19:30.700 --> 19:34.070
And you this is a very important part insofar as your Mickey Mouse.

19:34.070 --> 19:36.800
Now if I'm going to combat again I can make

19:44.700 --> 19:46.170
it works perfectly fine.

19:46.290 --> 19:52.230
So I don't know if I am going to delete this dependency and I compiled it in

19:56.570 --> 19:56.980
OK.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.950
It's going to make the same error as before.

20:00.330 --> 20:04.460
Well Gates says that you cannot find there is this problem.

20:04.590 --> 20:11.680
OK Joe the message is has to be alive but is not used as a B.

20:12.250 --> 20:12.810
OK.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.340
It's not just use as a B.

20:14.370 --> 20:21.050
And that's what we need to put you back in the competition.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.700
So often successful compilation.

20:31.010 --> 20:33.680
Now we are ready to execute our No.

20:34.010 --> 20:38.440
But before this is the last step is actually to test the mood.

20:38.450 --> 20:40.440
I'm going to take this code.

20:40.570 --> 20:49.550
Why don't we ask the user under his feet and the distance that direction.

20:50.030 --> 20:52.690
And finally to execute the method more.

20:53.150 --> 20:53.730
OK.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.790
We him remove this

20:57.670 --> 21:05.790
of course all of the namespace using the name is

21:11.950 --> 21:20.500
and we also define the variables and that is in that instance

21:23.520 --> 21:27.070
boolean use or

21:34.360 --> 21:37.510
I'm going to combine again.

21:37.810 --> 21:40.590
Make If that is your goal for completion.

21:40.590 --> 21:44.650
Also another way to do it using Project B.

21:44.730 --> 21:49.640
PAUL So you do exactly the same thing project.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.230
All fun and you with what I'm

21:56.250 --> 22:01.990
going to make us run so that follow.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.150
That is good to see.

22:06.120 --> 22:10.150
You know I could have anyone do that.

22:10.260 --> 22:14.690
But before this let's all the first

22:21.920 --> 22:22.940
this you know.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.370
So this is these to not your.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.760
Now this is our application Great just what I need.

22:31.010 --> 22:32.210
So under this.

22:32.360 --> 22:38.750
That's me doing the distance 5 and forword Yes

22:42.150 --> 22:42.700
OK.

22:42.710 --> 22:49.910
So this is not the execution of that you well let's make it work with a speed that will to fight for

22:49.910 --> 22:54.330
the same distance and also allow it's back to you

22:57.790 --> 22:58.210
OK.

22:58.210 --> 23:04.120
So it's a little bit tired because of the distance but you can maybe we can make it more accurate if

23:04.130 --> 23:05.270
you want.

23:05.560 --> 23:12.240
So one thing you can do to make it more accurate is actually hearing what you read.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.510
OK.

23:13.560 --> 23:18.400
I'm going to make one hundred messages per second instead of 10 messages.

23:18.390 --> 23:21.950
Says that's what the date is going to be more frequent.

23:22.070 --> 23:24.130
Again oh by the way

23:28.210 --> 23:33.490
use the known OK.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.410
Let's show our to the.

23:38.410 --> 23:42.540
One way to make it is to Wow.

23:46.460 --> 23:53.520
And going to in school like

23:58.370 --> 24:03.480
OK so it's more OK to go to some other news

24:07.140 --> 24:08.020
disagree.

24:08.040 --> 24:13.770
This is what you see it's not just fun things that you're seconds in the back of that action.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.260
So it's pretty much fine.

24:23.710 --> 24:29.110
So in the next story I'm going to show how we can make a decent day.

24:29.390 --> 24:39.280
And also how to set up a vision for how to make to take a certain design that I'm good at.

24:39.530 --> 24:47.090
So if you have any suggestions or comments about this so please step below and you can also find the

24:47.090 --> 24:49.580
complete code just to look for us.

24:49.850 --> 24:50.800
Thank you very much.
