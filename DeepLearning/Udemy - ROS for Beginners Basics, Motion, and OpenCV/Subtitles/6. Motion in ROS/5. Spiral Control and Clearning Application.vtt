00:04.040 --> 00:11.930
Something OK so that's part of the story it is actually to be an application itself.

00:11.990 --> 00:16.370
So I'm going to propose two ways to get the cleaning application.

00:16.400 --> 00:16.910
OK.

00:16.910 --> 00:20.790
So the first one to greet me.

00:20.990 --> 00:24.860
OK that's one great lady.

00:24.980 --> 00:25.520
OK.

00:25.520 --> 00:33.410
And this actually made me go to straight lines making terms and then continued straight line so that

00:33.510 --> 00:38.180
it makes it bleed when it makes the page.

00:38.180 --> 00:42.030
So here are going to define the.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.800
Great.

00:46.030 --> 00:50.600
OK so this is a possible implementation of the great key.

00:50.720 --> 00:51.880
It is very simple.

00:51.890 --> 00:59.300
So in the beginning are going to determine our rights as the final goal post which is from.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.880
So this is a bold one.

01:00.920 --> 01:01.750
Wow.

01:01.910 --> 01:02.610
OK.

01:02.780 --> 01:06.590
So what we are going to call is going to.

01:06.720 --> 01:17.970
So the most with up was issue one that supposedly supposedly going to make the robot get to the desired

01:18.570 --> 01:22.230
zero along the x axis.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.110
OK.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.150
And finally got to make straight lines of rotation.

01:26.150 --> 01:30.540
So here it's going to move for 90 days.

01:30.890 --> 01:35.850
So he's going to move now you can do this with two units per second.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.730
And then when it uses them.

01:37.760 --> 01:43.750
So from one to that then it's going to rotate OK with 90 degrees.

01:43.860 --> 01:49.620
OK this means counterclockwise and then it's going to move along.

01:50.120 --> 01:56.700
And that is going to turn again to the left side with 90 degrees.

01:56.940 --> 02:03.790
And so this is actually going to be for some time until the hole is caught.

02:03.800 --> 02:18.140
So let's look at it like this grease cleaner first combine and then secured OK.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.530
First of all the method in the main function.

02:21.570 --> 02:24.830
So I'm going to call the method Gary.

02:25.550 --> 02:28.230
We may.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.940
OK I need to it again

02:35.750 --> 02:41.040
on because the first goes to the position one

02:44.120 --> 02:52.780
goes to the position one then two days after it reaches the orientations your ok and then it makes the

02:52.780 --> 02:59.490
left or 90 degrees OK and then it goes for 90 minutes.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.750
And then it makes it easier station and so.

03:03.790 --> 03:10.880
So the press is reporting that the whole area is actually covered by the see.

03:11.300 --> 03:14.460
So this is a possible way we have used the different methods.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.730
Got to go you know to go to that point.

03:16.910 --> 03:27.460
So I decided to point to the rotation with the under the zero and then move to move the state line.

03:27.480 --> 03:32.830
And so OK.

03:33.830 --> 03:39.750
So there are other ways to perform the duties of the patient and the second way is to do it in this

03:40.870 --> 03:41.430
fashion.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.420
OK.

03:42.570 --> 03:51.680
Actually it means so you're letting to keep turning around and with an increasing radius and the whole

03:51.680 --> 03:53.140
area.

03:54.290 --> 04:00.080
So the second right now you're going to do it using this for the

04:02.790 --> 04:07.190
method to define the spring cleaning method now.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.760
OK.

04:08.880 --> 04:15.090
Is that going to make your day in the.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.110
So how it was.

04:17.580 --> 04:18.050
OK.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.490
Of course you need to create the message.

04:20.680 --> 04:28.850
So this is we are going to put your philosophy on you this message to publish it.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.320
OK so let's assume the other costumes see the form.

04:33.370 --> 04:34.720
This is from the of

04:37.630 --> 04:40.240
doe OK.

04:40.500 --> 04:47.140
I'm going to play here and the message.

04:47.190 --> 04:55.440
So you start to rise mathematically by a constant under-sea.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.530
OK.

04:56.550 --> 05:01.690
So takes the officer if you would like me to day.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.580
So this is what you do.

05:03.750 --> 05:13.350
You are going to put the city on the end of the business if you if you make you lose your add another

05:13.370 --> 05:19.260
list to a certain cost and so when you rotate it looks OK.

05:19.450 --> 05:33.510
Now if you book a constant battle for the X and the cost of bad news for you and the Z in this case

05:34.420 --> 05:45.680
a search because the other book is characterized by the and it's OK and this is not you looking at my

05:45.680 --> 05:56.910
books after you've released Ruby the real you should be bothered by the angular velocity so to make

05:57.060 --> 06:07.440
the day instead of what we should do we should increase the ability so that the radius will also increase

06:08.220 --> 06:18.960
because it is constant then it has certainly the constant radius but says that it increases the risk

06:18.960 --> 06:21.240
of the circle which is over time.

06:21.510 --> 06:22.200
OK.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.430
And finally when he last year.

06:24.630 --> 06:28.580
That's the whole idea of the space.

06:28.970 --> 06:29.330
OK.

06:29.330 --> 06:36.840
And finally we are going to do this under the position of the robot reaches the boundaries.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.620
That's the last stopping condition.

06:38.640 --> 06:45.390
And finally you want to force the rubble to stop by publishing the message.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.680
OK let's look how that works.

06:47.680 --> 07:02.440
Now I'm going to call this for you here and now I have to go by and large myself you can see now easily

07:02.470 --> 07:03.050
deep.

07:03.330 --> 07:03.820
OK.

07:03.960 --> 07:15.130
So it's because we have a coastal city and you can see the radius of the sun increasing because the

07:15.820 --> 07:18.590
closing is also increasing.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.610
And this is done using this equation here.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.160
OK.

07:25.530 --> 07:34.420
The equation of the you live like with Eddie is increased by five

07:37.560 --> 07:40.810
now which is the bomb that these other rocket stops.

07:41.100 --> 07:41.750
OK.

07:41.850 --> 07:49.510
So at this point five can have a bigger if you want to make it bigger here for example 1.0.

07:49.690 --> 07:58.180
Well so to see that it really is much me but the radius will also be a bit bigger.

07:58.290 --> 07:58.980
Compiler

08:03.700 --> 08:04.720
is again

08:07.450 --> 08:13.340
OK you can see it's increasing faster and faster.

08:13.450 --> 08:18.520
So you can play in the bottom here on specifying the radius

08:22.300 --> 08:26.580
but specifying that it is all the stops.

08:28.110 --> 08:31.470
OK so this will lead to the end of the tutorial.

08:32.070 --> 08:32.570
OK.

08:32.610 --> 08:42.740
So in this story I have resort to different methods including the method and the routine method to make

08:42.740 --> 08:49.600
a robot move forward and also to rotate left and right with a certain speed also.

08:49.760 --> 08:57.860
Also I have to find a way to go in order to make an normal move from one point to another point for

08:57.920 --> 09:00.170
from one location to another location.

09:00.530 --> 09:08.270
So the first that you have reused all these methods in order to be a good Gleaner where the rubber meets

09:08.360 --> 09:16.760
straight Motors and then when and the second step he had also made a spill over where the rubber actually

09:16.760 --> 09:22.790
covered the area by maybe going to use fallaciously an increasing radius.

09:22.880 --> 09:30.290
So I hope you have provided you with sufficient background on the main process of the robot operating

09:30.290 --> 09:37.890
systems including publishing topics subscribing to topics and also processing messages.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.250
Thank you for watching.
