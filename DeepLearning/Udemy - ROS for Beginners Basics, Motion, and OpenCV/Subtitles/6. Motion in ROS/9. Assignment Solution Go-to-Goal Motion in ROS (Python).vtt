WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:02.800
Now the search function is then go to a good location.

00:02.970 --> 00:06.060
And here it takes as parameter the go location.

00:06.060 --> 00:11.220
It's got rid of the location of the right location and the objective here is actually to dig that up

00:11.220 --> 00:13.650
from one location it's up from here to here.

00:13.650 --> 00:15.570
OK we want to start from this one.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.000
OK so how can we do this we can actually make a rotation into this.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.520
And then they're moving straight but that is not a smooth motion.

00:22.530 --> 00:27.980
We want to make a smooth motion so that the robot moves automatically to this location here and then

00:28.130 --> 00:30.420
confidence up and started the cleaning mission.

00:30.570 --> 00:37.330
So in order to do this we're going to use the the controller as already explained the C++ version.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.070
OK.

00:38.070 --> 00:41.700
So this robot is going to move from this one to this point.

00:41.970 --> 00:48.720
So what we can do we can set the linear velocity and that it is looking at this direction we can set

00:48.750 --> 00:55.370
the linear velocity as proportional to the distance to the GO location.

00:55.620 --> 01:01.800
So when it is far from the location for example the US is going to be high.

01:01.830 --> 01:04.540
So it's going to move fast to where to go.

01:04.740 --> 01:12.390
And as it is approaching the goal location is going to use its linear speed and that it stops completely

01:12.690 --> 01:15.680
when it reaches this point safety.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.140
So you can see in either direction is this Rachel.

01:19.170 --> 01:23.320
Actually it has to rotate either in this direction or either in that direction.

01:23.400 --> 01:30.420
So we need to apply at the same time an angular velocity so that to make a smooth motion and smooth

01:30.420 --> 01:32.710
rotation toward the location.

01:32.850 --> 01:36.540
OK so I really explain the mathematics in the C++ version.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.200
OK.

01:37.380 --> 01:39.740
And here we're going to calculate the distance.

01:39.780 --> 01:46.560
So the distance is between the current location and the go location will be calculated using the linear

01:47.040 --> 01:47.640
equation.

01:47.670 --> 01:53.760
And then I'm going to set a speed that will do the distance multiplied by some kind of constant.

01:53.760 --> 01:59.710
This is what we call it proportional control because here it is proportional to the error and the error

01:59.710 --> 02:05.480
in this case is actually the distance when the distance is equal to the location the linear is going

02:05.550 --> 02:06.790
to be equal to zero.

02:06.830 --> 02:09.870
The Robert is going to stop and this is what you want.

02:10.790 --> 02:11.430
OK.

02:11.440 --> 02:17.790
And of course this constant can be any cause of your choice in some cases you have to do it carefully.

02:17.790 --> 02:22.540
Otherwise you can have a bad behavior or an expected behavior.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.780
So 0.5 would be fine.

02:25.810 --> 02:34.740
But if the moment OK this is what concerns the NTSB and we will do the same for the animals first of

02:34.740 --> 02:36.660
all we need to calculate the desired angle.

02:36.690 --> 02:42.120
So now this robot is looking in this direction and you want it to go to that direction.

02:42.120 --> 02:48.800
So look the whole angle we need to measure this hole and the OK.

02:48.850 --> 02:56.110
In theory we can use that tangent method in order to calculate the angle between this location and this

02:56.110 --> 02:57.080
location.

02:57.280 --> 03:04.620
And this is one to our attention to the position of wind gold mine and slide the current location of

03:04.620 --> 03:07.690
that about an X goal minus x.

03:07.750 --> 03:12.100
This is the current location of the X location of the rover.

03:12.410 --> 03:12.760
OK.

03:12.760 --> 03:20.560
Using this equation you can turn that angle into a date and then the angle speed will be proportional

03:20.650 --> 03:26.920
to the angle the difference between that and the desired angle and or minus the current rotation of

03:26.910 --> 03:27.300
the rubber.

03:27.310 --> 03:33.720
So this is going to give me the relative to rotate in order to move to the location and as such and

03:33.740 --> 03:39.580
the spin is going to be different from zero as long as the difference is different from zero.

03:39.740 --> 03:45.300
The angle is equal to the center of the what then is going to become zero.

03:45.310 --> 03:51.190
And in this case you will guarantee that the rubber is going to rotate to war the ball location.

03:51.420 --> 03:51.900
OK.

03:51.970 --> 03:55.630
And it looks straight to the location in this case.

03:55.630 --> 03:57.940
This component is going to be zero.

03:57.950 --> 04:04.260
And finally we will Abdeen the velocity message X by the leniency that we have calculated here.

04:04.350 --> 04:06.630
I'm going to see that you have got created here.

04:06.670 --> 04:13.410
And finally you publish the first message and maybe even this is smaller than a certain threshold to

04:13.410 --> 04:19.240
the location because we cannot have an exact equality between the location of the current location because

04:19.240 --> 04:22.490
these are low numbers so exactly why it is impossible.

04:22.540 --> 04:28.380
So in this case I'm going to use a small three shot just to make sure that the distance is smaller to

04:28.380 --> 04:29.700
a very small value.

04:29.950 --> 04:35.340
OK in this case I would consider that they have Richy and then exit the Y.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.140
This is what you will do.

04:37.300 --> 04:40.070
And we can check this behavior here.

04:40.070 --> 04:42.190
So for example I would go to one.

04:42.220 --> 04:42.670
Wow.

04:42.820 --> 04:45.760
So now let us try and go to one function.

04:45.910 --> 04:51.440
We're going to move that from this location that is almost five five point one.

04:51.590 --> 04:52.360
Wow.

04:52.870 --> 04:53.420
OK.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.710
So let's see how it works.

04:58.300 --> 05:04.520
Insecurely and then you can see this is a smooth motion.

05:04.530 --> 05:13.420
One the go location OK so it's going to continue moving and it reaches almost the desired point.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.650
So the next strategy is for example to send an

05:23.820 --> 05:26.150
I'm going to bring the x y here

05:29.380 --> 05:31.250
to bring the x y coordinates

05:33.880 --> 05:38.840
I would expect you to get.

05:38.970 --> 05:49.130
You can see more than eight inches X-Fi calling it book it's almost seven here and almost eight here

05:50.700 --> 05:51.170
or one.

05:51.190 --> 05:52.760
This is very very small.

05:52.810 --> 05:57.570
Seven point ninety nine and six that night the it's almost seven and eight.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.620
So what are you going to stop tonight.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.840
I'm demanding three behaviors.

06:02.920 --> 06:03.990
Move on.

06:04.340 --> 06:09.990
Go to go now we have all the ingredients into need cleaning.

06:10.020 --> 06:10.610
Publication

06:13.880 --> 06:14.920
but of course.

06:15.050 --> 06:26.870
So the message got to the position 1 1 the beginning from the they give birth to 1 1 you'll see

06:31.270 --> 06:34.320
what is going to look into that action.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.100
Now I want to move straight in this line like this.

06:38.380 --> 06:38.970
OK.

06:39.160 --> 06:46.960
So these kids have to go out and make each politician in addition to zero in this case so we need a

06:46.960 --> 06:51.350
method that we rotate rubber under the orientation.

06:51.730 --> 06:52.140
OK.

06:52.170 --> 06:57.960
For example these days I want to make it in this direction so it can move straight into research.

06:58.130 --> 07:01.870
And for this when we do a method that's all said orientation.
