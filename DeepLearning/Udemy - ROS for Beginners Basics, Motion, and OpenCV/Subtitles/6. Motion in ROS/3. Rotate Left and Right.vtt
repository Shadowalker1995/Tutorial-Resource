WEBVTT

00:01.350 --> 00:04.640
Muslim it will snowball my son.

00:05.040 --> 00:10.730
OK so this is the continuation of the total see Gleaner.

00:10.950 --> 00:19.640
So I demand that is only completed the word function.

00:19.850 --> 00:20.430
OK.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.260
So no we cannot test

00:25.030 --> 00:26.860
this notification.

00:27.030 --> 00:36.480
And here we are a method that is the method what it takes to keep the city of Oakland puts the distance

00:36.540 --> 00:40.390
and also for work with teachers for work.

00:40.400 --> 00:48.690
And then he moves now your objective is to make the rotate operation.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.570
OK so you means to me also rotate operation.

00:52.700 --> 01:00.330
And for this our goal is to plot the reading.

01:00.890 --> 01:01.590
OK.

01:03.470 --> 01:09.110
So you admit that the method like what it takes.

01:09.200 --> 01:16.920
And here we have another story the other day and also whether it is clockwise or counter.

01:17.210 --> 01:21.540
So let me first clarify that there is a massive rotation.

01:21.580 --> 01:27.430
So consider this the this is mobile and this is the ex-porn unique in the Waikato.

01:27.800 --> 01:35.510
So the rotation is going to be called loquats.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.440
OK.

01:36.630 --> 01:42.290
So this kind of rotation is part of the Malaysian commercial.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.730
So here is part of the

01:46.720 --> 01:56.240
if this is made clockwise these days you have a negative which is

02:00.420 --> 02:02.990
not implementing it.

02:03.130 --> 02:12.110
So here we have one for days and then a the the book was the counterclockwise.

02:12.190 --> 02:17.320
So basically going will be around the z axis.

02:17.320 --> 02:17.850
OK.

02:17.890 --> 02:27.490
So the goal part of being able to sleep of on because we are not looking for any new here any more.

02:27.850 --> 02:38.890
So we are going to swallow and that she and for now we need actually to put a satellite and easy access

02:39.210 --> 02:42.420
both off the killer.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.930
This is the message so you find this message.

02:46.930 --> 02:51.950
And as you know it's composed of three year the loss in angular velocity.

02:52.230 --> 03:01.990
Needless to say you know we are going to specify the so we have two cases whether it is clockwise or

03:02.010 --> 03:03.850
counter-clockwise.

03:04.570 --> 03:08.600
OK so we have to decent accounts and this should be the code.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.690
So the rotation is clockwise.

03:11.980 --> 03:18.120
The second part of it you get as much growth wise.

03:18.180 --> 03:25.790
Miss Negahban so I'm going to put a negative value minus the accident.

03:25.880 --> 03:39.510
And so this impose legally binding will have in clockwise or in the chain on the engine of the that's

03:40.480 --> 03:42.180
OK.

03:43.110 --> 03:45.300
So you have to be

03:48.900 --> 03:57.860
for actually publishing Lesage if you buy those of Mrs..

03:58.700 --> 03:59.940
OK.

04:00.470 --> 04:02.090
We are ready.

04:02.290 --> 04:02.780
OK.

04:02.810 --> 04:06.050
So I'm going to publish a message.

04:06.370 --> 04:06.980
Why

04:09.570 --> 04:10.850
ok.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.330
Keep publishing the message.

04:13.480 --> 04:19.340
Why do the spec is smaller.

04:19.760 --> 04:34.850
So of course the big angle to be able to zero OK because of the total cost is not.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.870
And then we have to continue my research over time.

04:39.310 --> 04:50.510
So how to do this is the same way that we likely to calculate the time you have the anger out of those.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.690
OK.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.980
So actually the other

04:57.700 --> 05:01.680
decade it really measured be every two

05:06.220 --> 05:18.030
weeks is multiplied by the let's say you want Andi's you it's the time start.

05:18.050 --> 05:27.120
So what you want to is you will be just before three years ago.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.370
OK.

05:28.720 --> 05:34.520
I'm going to take the time before the low newsiest time now.

05:34.860 --> 05:35.590
Okay.

05:35.750 --> 05:36.440
And do you want

05:39.280 --> 05:49.210
me measured in some OK and you're going to teach us of course I should forgive me.

05:51.720 --> 05:59.200
What are the most and finally I mean have you seen for some time.

05:59.580 --> 06:00.270
OK.

06:00.410 --> 06:05.460
And here I have to find a new place you know.

06:05.670 --> 06:06.130
OK.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.140
So my new page is going to

06:11.520 --> 06:18.460
100 time that second really is too much time for.

06:18.790 --> 06:24.160
To find OK because otherwise Nobuyuki overhunting But first

06:26.870 --> 06:28.030
that's all I need to do.

06:28.030 --> 06:36.540
And finally if we need to do we need to start we need to start looking for something to publish.

06:36.550 --> 06:39.740
This is going to be just the effort to see.

06:39.830 --> 06:51.290
So I actually use my e-mail all day so that's this little one now in the same way.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.390
I'm going on with just no.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.230
So we go to the May.

07:08.640 --> 07:21.110
Was either on the other end of the street is going to be amongst the Boston in the anti-conspiracy specified

07:21.110 --> 07:23.260
clockwise or counter clockwise.

07:23.390 --> 07:26.120
And finally we want to call the

07:29.330 --> 07:36.580
section at the sun over this way and we as human being understood and understood to be so that you can

07:36.600 --> 07:42.490
make a complex degrees and this function doesn't exist so we have to define it.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.370
OK I'm going to the farm method.

07:50.230 --> 08:02.010
The Dacier I've been eating.

08:02.250 --> 08:02.800
OK.

08:02.840 --> 08:08.200
I'm just going to another OK it's going to be done in

08:11.340 --> 08:16.000
everything that's tested.

08:16.010 --> 08:25.550
So let me know the it's very simple just below here.

08:26.420 --> 08:30.700
I'm going to be fine so easily it takes another.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.890
And he told me in basement.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.320
Bye bye Bye bye.

08:35.600 --> 08:42.420
One hundred eighty one does or does he only cost them by the school.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.430
Look what you've got.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.470
Look for the pipeline.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.280
OK so everything is really just sort of function.

08:54.670 --> 08:58.090
You can buy game.

08:58.510 --> 09:00.000
Oh it looks fine.

09:00.150 --> 09:01.520
It is delicious.

09:03.240 --> 09:07.780
OK an artist or something like that.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.620
We have no knowledge OK.

09:11.690 --> 09:13.270
We chose both politics.

09:13.320 --> 09:13.940
No.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.520
Nope nope.

09:17.690 --> 09:30.670
That's why I'm going to use those words OK so this is also OK not the test.

09:31.670 --> 09:34.840
This is going to be a.

09:35.580 --> 09:36.480
For that actually.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.500
Yes.

09:37.950 --> 09:38.680
OK.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.110
Now on to the US.

09:41.580 --> 09:45.710
So let me make it like two things open.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.810
I think it's going to fall for this.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.130
OK.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.870
It's going to be going clockwise from here.

09:55.430 --> 09:59.380
And you can see them Robert is actually imitating counterclockwise.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.440
OK.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.760
And he's going to stop teaching us.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.840
And that's the case.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.520
So now I can do this again.

10:12.100 --> 10:12.480
Just

10:23.930 --> 10:25.670
so this is the new normal.

10:26.260 --> 10:26.830
OK.

10:26.950 --> 10:29.850
And that's in no wise.

10:30.130 --> 10:34.790
So let me go to 30 degrees for a second.

10:34.790 --> 10:39.390
Again 90 degrees but not once or twice.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.710
So with winter.

10:45.260 --> 10:55.050
Methods of methods will undertake these components for a petition because you question the sequence

10:56.100 --> 10:59.210
of your own motions.

10:59.650 --> 11:00.470
OK.

11:04.770 --> 11:10.500
So before moving to the application let's assume that you let it go.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.400
So the absolute absolutely not.

11:13.650 --> 11:18.920
Because nobody will say this.

11:19.650 --> 11:25.200
But now that I would like to pull those orientation into 60 degrees.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.420
Absolutely.

11:26.470 --> 11:34.330
What that means is to respond to the six is under or to the 90 degrees and whatever it is it's it is

11:35.400 --> 11:40.480
important for example to this you actually are like direction.

11:40.920 --> 11:46.250
So for this girl to make another method that is close.

11:46.510 --> 11:48.440
These are all issues.

11:48.660 --> 11:50.270
Absolute action.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.810
OK.

11:51.870 --> 11:53.650
I'm going to define it now.

11:55.390 --> 12:00.280
Delusional is the duration or the method.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.370
So these are only shown OK.

12:03.790 --> 12:11.400
That work is going to to a certain aptitude orientation.

12:11.810 --> 12:12.480
OK.

12:12.590 --> 12:24.060
What is up here I would like to not be pointing to take whatever it is it'll be for you.

12:24.440 --> 12:32.300
So it's way too ridiculous so what we need to do we need to get rid of them between the orientation

12:32.450 --> 12:33.840
and the this.

12:33.910 --> 12:39.480
So this is the time of the implementation of the design orientation.

12:40.010 --> 12:44.910
So you got light to follow.

12:45.170 --> 12:46.900
OK so as I mentioned.

12:47.130 --> 13:00.520
First of all first ladies and then the other day to the letter B C the desired inradius minus what you

13:00.610 --> 13:01.600
supposed to do.

13:01.630 --> 13:05.160
So what do you suppose that that.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.220
This is the current orientation of the road.

13:08.670 --> 13:12.450
This is the issue of how get this.

13:12.990 --> 13:13.700
OK.

13:13.800 --> 13:19.760
So is this using a subscriber to the polls.

13:19.980 --> 13:24.720
So here is subscriber disco's subscriber.

13:24.840 --> 13:32.950
So I remember OK when you hear story this

13:35.830 --> 13:38.300
and you have a problem that needs polls.

13:38.590 --> 13:39.200
OK.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.810
So we can inside the polls.

13:42.650 --> 13:46.260
Most of the one poll

13:52.140 --> 13:58.330
so can see that the board is an excellent point and the y component also take a couple that make.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.460
Right.

13:59.690 --> 14:03.660
OK so I can see that information about the post.

14:04.620 --> 14:12.670
Ok so it's a stipend so I need to make a subscriber to the publisher of a post I made to make subscribing

14:12.680 --> 14:18.120
don't know what is the x y or z value of literacy.

14:18.230 --> 14:19.640
That's what we do here.

14:19.820 --> 14:23.810
We define a subscriber that is the subscriber here.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.400
And our main function

14:28.080 --> 14:38.670
is always fun to find the post subscribers so I'm wanting to find the post subscriber in the mail box

14:47.020 --> 14:49.320
OK so I will.

14:49.740 --> 14:59.970
Most of the mail function just after all this should so my post subscriber which is the local variable

14:59.970 --> 15:00.810
here.

15:01.500 --> 15:13.500
In line is defined as a subscriber to the one who's going to call those folks functions let me also

15:14.550 --> 15:29.940
so say I might go back to my days as part of the post message that is going to be see from the doggie.

15:30.110 --> 15:31.240
OK.

15:31.830 --> 15:32.790
Zippos.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.340
So this is exactly the title of the message.

15:37.850 --> 15:40.100
Okay.

15:40.530 --> 15:41.150
Okay.

15:41.240 --> 15:51.960
And in fact so what do we do in this method by going to a site that is obviously the message into a

15:51.950 --> 15:53.130
number.

15:53.130 --> 15:56.000
They only use data on our program.

15:56.310 --> 16:00.960
So here at issue is very simple and straightforward All I want to do here.

16:01.110 --> 16:03.060
The post is going to be what.

16:03.470 --> 16:14.530
So this is defined as a global date so its access is the whole program in terms of sport.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.850
Whenever people see.

16:17.070 --> 16:25.730
So its going to be so here suppose we can take the last information of the post of the turtles which

16:25.780 --> 16:32.880
I can only use for example for determining the current orientation of rope using that impose the death

16:33.390 --> 16:35.800
which is what you see in the post message.

16:36.050 --> 16:40.530
OK so the most opposed message is the message is receive a call back fancy.

16:40.530 --> 16:44.540
Whenever the position of all of this is updated.

16:44.890 --> 16:45.550
OK.

16:45.630 --> 16:53.320
So you this that they are going to be able to ID the the.

16:53.550 --> 17:02.860
And this is what one to use here in the same orientation so that the other is going to do the design

17:02.860 --> 17:04.300
of the radio.

17:04.600 --> 17:05.150
OK.

17:05.290 --> 17:13.590
Minus the third orientation they're also going to find them are going to determine whether it is clockwise

17:13.650 --> 17:15.320
or vice.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.200
OK.

17:16.210 --> 17:23.770
So the idea is that it is quite otherwise.

17:24.130 --> 17:24.980
Lol.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.040
Now it's very simple.

17:29.150 --> 17:32.540
I'm going to call the method.

17:32.630 --> 17:33.650
OK.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.600
OK.

17:34.670 --> 17:38.060
I'm going to be in play here.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.300
OK.

17:40.060 --> 17:46.910
Let's see the actual value of the other two OK.

17:47.040 --> 17:55.900
Here is what is the value for your not to test our program.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.960
It's very simple.

17:57.400 --> 18:06.440
I'm going to call the orientation orientation of course not for me to do anything.

18:06.460 --> 18:16.460
So I would like to personally visualize or indeed the one with the degrees and then after two seconds.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.360
Minus six degrees and then let's say going to come back to let's make it a zillion

18:28.930 --> 18:30.040
OK.

18:31.070 --> 18:38.210
So you need to make the conversion because all of the eagerly.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.470
How have implemented.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.430
OK so the knobs are supposed to call

18:52.660 --> 18:55.630
and then we do it.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.860
So don't it you know.

18:59.140 --> 19:03.700
So it's good to get a piece of what we.

19:03.830 --> 19:11.660
Well really that minus 60 degrees and this finally goes to zero.

19:13.060 --> 19:16.230
So these are all here.
