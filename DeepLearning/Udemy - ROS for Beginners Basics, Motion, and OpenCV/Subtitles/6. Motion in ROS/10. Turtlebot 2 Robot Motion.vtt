00:00.570 --> 00:04.470
In the previous videos you have showed how to make a scene movie.

00:04.740 --> 00:09.640
In this video I'm going to show you that we can use actually the same code to move a real robot like

00:09.640 --> 00:11.290
for example the total book too.

00:11.320 --> 00:16.930
So in this video I'm going to show what some modification you have to do on the to see motion script

00:17.020 --> 00:21.030
in order to make that real robot that'll work to movie.

00:21.070 --> 00:22.060
So let's see how it works.

00:22.060 --> 00:26.560
First of all let me remind about the code so this is the code that we need for that to see more of what

00:26.560 --> 00:29.590
we do find a Makes move for word game.

00:29.650 --> 00:36.200
On the topic title one CMT event and here another function that is a state that makes the robot rotating

00:36.340 --> 00:40.330
and he will win just to execute more of 0.3 meters.

00:40.360 --> 00:40.890
OK.

00:40.910 --> 00:41.920
The backwards action.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.700
And then it would rotate in the clockwise direction.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.230
Now execute the code for him to see what I need to start to score and then play up and you tell me that

00:52.360 --> 00:58.950
I'm going to run the total simulator on the same note.

00:59.410 --> 01:06.750
OK so you have the simulator here and then we all started because the sensors and then we have to see

01:07.090 --> 01:08.360
him back.

01:08.530 --> 01:09.390
OK.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.020
And you can see now it going backwards.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.550
And then he could hit it in the clockwise direction.

01:14.740 --> 01:21.080
So what we want to make every little bit training and moving should we make too much changes in this

01:21.080 --> 01:21.470
video.

01:21.490 --> 01:24.840
I'm going to illustrate this on about two simulator.

01:24.880 --> 01:32.460
And by the way the same code can be also executed on the but to Robert let the first the close to him.

01:33.280 --> 01:38.050
Ok now I'm going to start to call back to you later.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.630
So I assume that you have already installed that too.

01:40.750 --> 01:51.700
If not you can do all pretty good things and then press my schematic and then you make turtle but dash

01:51.960 --> 01:53.910
stuck if you don't after that.

01:54.050 --> 01:57.090
Executed in this case you have to execute this command.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.250
OK so it is now creating 20 packages.

02:01.340 --> 02:05.170
But it's already installed on my computer so it is just upgrading for now.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.630
Now it's finished.

02:07.010 --> 02:14.170
And then we start to the commanders lounge underscored stage and then to the stage book launch.

02:14.180 --> 02:21.100
So this is going to start the start of boat simulator OK let me explain these interfaces.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.230
So the first interface is called armies.

02:24.950 --> 02:28.730
This one and this is actually very useful.

02:28.730 --> 02:33.000
You can use interface trusts which is called Cross visualization.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.260
What are these.

02:34.340 --> 02:39.380
It allows you to show the map a little bit and all its characteristics.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.740
For example here you can see this is the robot model.

02:41.810 --> 02:44.380
It can check or uncheck.

02:44.480 --> 02:50.600
You can see it here you can see for example here it is a scanner information they're going to study

02:50.600 --> 02:52.160
this in the future lectures.

02:52.190 --> 02:55.610
So I can use this a little bit to see the sights.

02:55.700 --> 03:00.800
So there are a lot of characteristics that really cannot tell you the location of the obstacles.

03:00.850 --> 03:05.310
OK so we have an obstacle here and that's an obstacle here using the laser scanner.

03:05.450 --> 03:08.020
We're going to have a complete chapter about these or something like that.

03:08.030 --> 03:15.800
So what you know about is their scanners and you can do a lot of things here but I'm going just to develop

03:15.800 --> 03:20.910
a small program that makes this robot more and another interface is this stage suited.

03:20.950 --> 03:24.340
So stage is a simulator of robots.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.710
We can also give you some data.

03:28.730 --> 03:33.410
So this is the laser scanner but you can see here and this is where we see an obstacle.

03:33.410 --> 03:39.550
We're not in here because of the laser is looking at these obstacles at these distances.

03:39.870 --> 03:40.780
OK.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.960
So this is not important for us for the moment.

03:42.970 --> 03:47.170
What is important is how to make use of actually for this.

03:47.280 --> 03:54.100
And the first thing that you see is the list of topics available as using the

03:58.500 --> 04:00.900
unhearing find a lot of topics.

04:01.870 --> 04:06.850
It's different from what I've seen not only three or four topics that really have a lot of topics.

04:06.990 --> 04:12.120
Of course several of them are made medication some others are made it to the camera and some of those

04:12.450 --> 04:20.110
formations are what is important for now is to know what he's picked the pace.

04:20.580 --> 04:24.670
And here you can see several topics starting to see and be ready.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.750
OK.

04:26.060 --> 04:33.840
Does it tell you that the topic that makes the robot mode is mix especially for slushed video.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.900
So if you want to make more it's very simple.

04:37.900 --> 04:42.920
I mean just don't use the Sims 3 and change the topic.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.820
Body needs input.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.320
I'm going to do that.

04:48.390 --> 04:52.220
So this is the topic that is used in the day before.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.270
But see what it does.

04:54.330 --> 04:59.450
OK so open can use us for and then check what's what's happening here.

04:59.460 --> 05:07.320
So the type of message is it's exactly the same as the message side of events.

05:07.530 --> 05:08.160
Of these.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.990
Basically the message strike or even the last month.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.370
This is the list of publishers and subscribers.

05:14.370 --> 05:23.250
So now if we go to misfiled to see underscored by so I have talked about that more exactly to see something

05:23.330 --> 05:24.730
seen the point of pirate.

05:24.740 --> 05:29.550
So the only way to do is the name of the topic on this.

05:29.610 --> 05:34.680
Look here interrupted see in the CBD the topic is just a little lost on you.

05:34.770 --> 05:38.520
You have to be this topic name of the company.

05:38.550 --> 05:43.490
Here in the name of the command and command of it is going to be useful.

05:43.500 --> 05:47.270
So they have to make sure that that is me.

05:47.350 --> 05:47.630
OK.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.200
Another to go the same experiment.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.520
I didn't change anything.

05:50.520 --> 05:56.080
So if you compare the calls for a to see and you can go turtle but it's exactly the same.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.810
But when you hear one of them to calculate the distance using this multiplied by time.

06:00.810 --> 06:08.240
So in this example I'm going to use the median distance because the way has been present in a pool but

06:08.280 --> 06:11.300
it's different from the way how the force is represented.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.750
See we're going to see this is a bigger stage so I was just using the simple formula that these things

06:16.760 --> 06:20.580
must be equal to the speed multiplied by the curation all the time.

06:20.580 --> 06:27.090
And same here for the rotation the angle didn't and B B and the low speed multiplied by the duration

06:27.090 --> 06:27.540
of time.

06:27.550 --> 06:35.130
OK I don't need this go to work function for the moment but I'm going to spin it here and we'll just

06:35.740 --> 06:43.020
move the 0.3 meters in the backwards direction of the gunfire or the action and then rotate clockwise

06:43.170 --> 06:44.350
90 degrees.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.010
OK let's see how it works.

06:47.190 --> 06:52.820
OK so now I'm going to make some of them move.

06:52.940 --> 07:00.150
OK here I'm going to move a distance 1.5 Earth speed point five before that action

07:02.940 --> 07:04.630
rotate 90 degrees.

07:04.710 --> 07:09.600
So you there's a bunch of these later and then make that up.

07:12.470 --> 07:19.870
And then rotating continuously so does is exactly the same speed as the turtle soup with absolutely

07:19.870 --> 07:21.090
no difference.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.960
I can only go over one point five meters.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.070
But what about actually.

07:26.160 --> 07:33.200
And then for example the turn of the clockwise monkey with the

07:36.340 --> 07:46.690
Molly Barkworth then that counter-clockwise is really what happens onto how you let go.

07:47.030 --> 07:52.590
But you have the balls for the nerve to make the cotton ball too much money.

07:52.850 --> 08:01.070
So here something that this imitates Mozart and in between he's saying go lucky or

08:05.140 --> 08:05.460
bucket

08:09.210 --> 08:16.420
is doing this for less than the more buffler

08:19.830 --> 08:21.570
battledore.

08:22.190 --> 08:31.380
And then Winterton if you degassing go and try and find out if you have a daughter who just just go

08:31.640 --> 08:38.240
scope it you are talking to or what you have her when you see the novel is going to behave exactly the

08:38.240 --> 08:45.110
same as in the simulator and this is why it also is very powerful because you can get over the same

08:45.110 --> 08:45.560
code.

08:45.560 --> 08:50.430
You can test the game simulator and then you can run it on the cover without any problem.
