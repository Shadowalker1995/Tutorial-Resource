00:02.120 --> 00:05.500
Snowball my son.

00:05.730 --> 00:14.400
Our next problem like stuff or something was sort of like you go from this position to his position

00:14.490 --> 00:19.170
which is pretty classes he could make straight lines.

00:19.260 --> 00:26.590
Now I would like to find another method that dildoe to go to a certain golden age.

00:26.980 --> 00:32.950
OK so I'm going to call this method the goal which I have to define close.

00:32.990 --> 00:39.370
It's not about define the method that is goal more goal.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.580
It takes two.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.620
And the first method is the goal.

00:42.630 --> 00:45.950
This is the point where I'm glad to see you go.

00:46.410 --> 00:54.400
And this is the this is others because of of course I cannot specify with complete accuracy but this

00:54.400 --> 00:58.560
is because somebody listens to us.

00:58.680 --> 01:05.750
So our goal now is actually to make moves to certain location is the co-location before diving into

01:05.830 --> 01:14.700
coding let's understand the theory behind the control of the robot in order to move to a certain point.

01:14.700 --> 01:25.620
So for what we call proportional control so a portion of the year we have two components one for literacy

01:26.040 --> 01:27.870
and the other one is for this theory.

01:27.920 --> 01:32.180
And also what we call the ability.

01:32.450 --> 01:37.780
So the that we make that the velocity of the robot.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.690
OK let me get in here.

01:39.900 --> 01:50.380
But in our case is a lot of the extraction will be a constant that multiplied by what is this.

01:50.380 --> 01:56.210
This is actually the distance between the location specified by exercise.

01:56.210 --> 02:03.190
This is the X of the goal location minus X of the current position of the robot.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.160
OK.

02:04.280 --> 02:09.570
That's the why of the work on hand that is also Square.

02:09.880 --> 02:17.820
OK so this is basically that it really is this and you can observe it as hard as the robot is approaching

02:18.000 --> 02:22.610
or this this is this this is become smaller and smaller.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.170
Ok it means this.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.860
This is with zero.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.550
And as a consequence the velocity.

02:28.550 --> 02:39.130
Also we want to zero in the same way we are going to define this thing and that is the stuff you take

02:39.130 --> 02:40.670
out of the goal.

02:40.840 --> 02:51.200
And this is defined by the standard or the difference between the y component of the position of the

02:51.200 --> 02:57.700
target the goal location minus the current position divided by x.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.740
Stop that all the gold mine is the X.

03:00.950 --> 03:07.090
So this is no can function that actually defines the balls or the anger.

03:07.140 --> 03:12.330
The old man at this point is the gold age.

03:12.410 --> 03:21.470
So what's the object of control for the city is actually to minimize the difference between the current

03:22.300 --> 03:28.160
orientation and the nation toward the goal point.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.540
So this is the difference between both.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.170
So why this difference.

03:33.200 --> 03:43.300
It's become become smaller and smaller so they also become smaller and smaller and we tend to feel the

03:43.300 --> 03:45.700
need to multiply by a certain constant.

03:45.730 --> 03:50.210
So of course it depends on the application each set.

03:50.260 --> 03:50.680
OK.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.310
And this forces must be greater.

03:53.550 --> 03:56.100
So with this we are going this year.

03:56.230 --> 04:09.850
Do we want to take the Undercity the proportion to the difference or the orientation to go are in the

04:09.850 --> 04:17.330
same way that any of in a city would be proportional to the distance between the goal location and the

04:17.490 --> 04:19.210
current position.

04:19.590 --> 04:24.270
Okay look too complicated can perform an implementation of the go to goal control.

04:24.270 --> 04:26.150
Let's not dismiss it.

04:26.170 --> 04:32.300
So the idea is that we are going to implement what we call a controller.

04:32.410 --> 04:40.420
First of all we find out message and that we are going to find any evidence of the anger that you saw

04:40.660 --> 04:51.940
here that your wife said it you know and I look at some of the why would I need to specify the university

04:52.590 --> 04:53.910
the x component.

04:54.180 --> 04:55.000
OK.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.590
And it's going to be proportional.

04:56.590 --> 05:06.220
That's what they call is proportional to the distance between the cars you should see at the GO position.

05:06.250 --> 05:13.620
So here I have to get a distance which is good but it really is.

05:13.660 --> 05:22.460
So the approaches the go that your ex will come to the gate when it is very close to the goal is going

05:22.480 --> 05:24.050
to be close to zero.

05:24.170 --> 05:27.420
And that is exactly the goal of course to be accurate.

05:27.440 --> 05:35.320
So safety for the city is proportional to the plunger all the way.

05:35.450 --> 05:40.420
And the most become when it becomes zero all day.

05:40.490 --> 05:43.870
So it didn't close to zero.

05:43.890 --> 05:53.970
So this is they despite all the two points on the issues that go under the sea.

05:54.620 --> 06:00.340
OK so this is going to be the opportunity to use the BP.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.080
That doesn't seem the goal direction.

06:03.220 --> 06:08.110
So why don't they see one that the same has the same.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.950
Yes definitely.

06:10.090 --> 06:14.140
Of course the last thing becomes because the.

06:14.410 --> 06:17.460
That's why we got onto it.

06:17.980 --> 06:23.470
This is the message not are going to publish them the business.

06:23.640 --> 06:32.390
The and is the most the goal because that is those dollars.

06:32.490 --> 06:38.540
And finally we are going to publish zero message you know too much to the book store.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.150
OK now let's test our program.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.100
So first of all we need to be fine.

06:43.380 --> 06:43.730
OK.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.360
Let's go.

06:45.410 --> 06:45.930
OK.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.200
This is the go goes to the five to one.

06:49.260 --> 06:49.990
Wow.

06:50.330 --> 06:59.210
And you get to sit here and finally make the move go ask to move to the goal point.

06:59.320 --> 07:07.680
This is OK so let's go out oh go and you could bill.

07:07.930 --> 07:13.660
And no this is good because you know so this is the position I want.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.040
So this is the position.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.090
This is why I'm here.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.340
So now Mr. Tickle was asked the question.

07:21.590 --> 07:25.310
So all in all up.

07:25.570 --> 07:30.790
So because of these polls you should know that we that straight.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.170
You see here.

07:32.380 --> 07:37.240
And so on so it's going to be we can't find any candidate other than that but this is one possible.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.240
Make sure you catch.
