It this letter I'm going to show you how to install up in Sydney for us.

00:03.780 --> 00:05.240
Actually it's pretty much simpler.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.690
So let's see how it works.

00:06.780 --> 00:09.690
Of course I assume that you have already installed.

00:09.690 --> 00:15.120
In my case I have Ruskin I think it's possible also to install any other version although there could

00:15.120 --> 00:20.370
be some differences between the versions of up and see the use in the different versions of Ross.

00:20.370 --> 00:25.380
So for example here in a row schematic up in Sivy virtuously is being used.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.710
So in a peaceful open Zeevi It's simple open a terminal.

00:31.500 --> 00:40.080
Then first of all update your system to do a pretty good idea to take some time to update your repositories.

00:42.580 --> 00:47.590
Now this system is updated so later on you're going to start oppositely by using.

00:47.600 --> 00:55.310
You do get installed Russ the version of Rush you have to make is it's kinetic options.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.170
So you can see and you have options here.

00:58.270 --> 00:58.880
Yes.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.850
And it is already installed in my system.

01:00.850 --> 01:06.640
So in your case it's going to install all PCD into your system.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.630
You can very fine if the OP is installed or not.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.430
You can use Python here.

01:13.430 --> 01:16.570
And then what you need to.

01:16.640 --> 01:22.580
So if you don't see any error it means that you have everything is stored correctly on your computer.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.610
You party two images in Port au in the library.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.160
You buy.

01:29.220 --> 01:29.790
You can exit.

01:29.800 --> 01:34.580
Now we may also need some additional ones.

01:34.650 --> 01:42.180
We also the install use camera package and this is also simple after first of all would need to update

01:42.180 --> 01:51.920
your system and then you do it should you get Ross version then.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.290
Yes we got.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.210
So in my case it's already installed.

01:59.400 --> 02:07.890
And also make sure that you have that image you know you can install the Ross version and then image

02:09.240 --> 02:15.810
so image view allows us to use images from USP or from other image topics.

02:15.850 --> 02:17.590
So I have already installed.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.440
So that's pretty much this other different tools that we need.

02:20.490 --> 02:24.790
And now we are ready actually to start a practical part of our city with us.
