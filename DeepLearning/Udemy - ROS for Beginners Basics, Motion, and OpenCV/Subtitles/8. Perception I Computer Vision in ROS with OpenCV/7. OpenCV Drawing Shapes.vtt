00:00.270 --> 00:06.720
One of the nice features of up and see is the ability to draw shapes it's possible to draw circles rectangles

00:06.810 --> 00:10.720
lines polygons and different kind of shapes so let's see how that works.

00:10.740 --> 00:16.980
So let us consider this very simple script here we import new pipe and pop and see the libraries and

00:16.980 --> 00:18.630
then we create an image.

00:18.630 --> 00:20.560
You'll see no pide and.

00:20.610 --> 00:27.740
So that zeros is going to create an image where all the values are used in this data structure of 512

00:27.750 --> 00:34.380
pixels by 500 pixels and containing three colors each red green and blue all of them will be set to

00:34.380 --> 00:35.000
zero.

00:35.010 --> 00:40.220
So we're going to have just a black image and this is the encoding of the image.

00:40.260 --> 00:45.720
It will be an inside integer over 8 bits and we'll open CVB can draw different shapes.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.660
For example we can draw a line we can draw a rectangle we can do that and lips.

00:50.730 --> 00:56.280
So for example when you want to draw a line you have to specify in which use you want to draw the line.

00:56.520 --> 01:04.350
You need to specify the start of the line and the end of the line and then the color of the line.

01:04.380 --> 01:10.690
So it's going to be white color because all the three RG dividers would be 255.

01:10.950 --> 01:15.090
And here the thickness of the line for the rectangle is also simple.

01:15.120 --> 01:21.090
You specify the image where you want to draw the rectangle in and you specify the coordinate of the

01:21.090 --> 01:24.430
left top corner and the bottom right corner.

01:24.510 --> 01:28.370
And here the color of the line of the rectangle which would be green in this case.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.750
And finally the thickness.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.350
Same thing also applies for the lips.

01:32.370 --> 01:34.900
And here we specify the coordinates of the center.

01:34.920 --> 01:41.760
The major axis and the minor axis not the start angle and angle thickness and the color as well.

01:41.850 --> 01:50.160
It is also possible to draw polygons and polygons are specified by an array and this array will be provided

01:50.220 --> 01:56.970
as an argument to polyline functions in options you to draw a polygon and also it is possible to put

01:56.970 --> 02:01.780
the text where you specify the location of the text and the font that will be used.

02:01.780 --> 02:04.910
So here we use the font we use the following font here.

02:05.190 --> 02:09.110
Then the color of a text and the thickness of the text.

02:09.150 --> 02:12.420
And finally we can show everything to the image.

02:12.420 --> 02:17.380
So let's try to run this example in a row and here let's go.

02:17.670 --> 02:23.130
So this is our line starting from zero with the last pixel here.

02:23.550 --> 02:25.150
And it has a white color.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.710
This is our rectangle.

02:26.710 --> 02:34.410
Here it is in green as you can see with the coordinates specified you specified the left top and the

02:34.410 --> 02:35.220
bottom right.

02:35.400 --> 02:42.690
And this is our polygon here in the yellow color and we have an ellipse in blue color.

02:42.690 --> 02:46.500
And finally we have a text with the white color here.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.810
So you can see up and see if he also provides functionality draw inside an image.

02:51.810 --> 02:57.720
So one of the uses of drawing is for example in object recognition you can use a rectangle to surround

02:57.720 --> 02:59.490
the object detected and recognize.
