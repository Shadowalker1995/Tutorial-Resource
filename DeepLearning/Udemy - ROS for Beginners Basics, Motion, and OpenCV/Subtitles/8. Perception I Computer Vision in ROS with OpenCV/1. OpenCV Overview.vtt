00:00.310 --> 00:06.690
The previous lectures we have presented the motion of the robot and how those represents the motion

00:06.690 --> 00:08.540
comments to make a robot move.

00:08.580 --> 00:14.220
However what we have done so far is kind of a blank motion without awareness of the surrounding environment

00:14.250 --> 00:16.140
of the robot in real applications.

00:16.170 --> 00:21.990
It is mandatory that a robot perceives the environment around it and extract useful information from

00:21.990 --> 00:26.670
the environment to be able to plan his motion and add in an appropriate fashion.

00:26.670 --> 00:33.150
This is referred to as robot perception which is a popular feeling robotics based on computer and computer

00:33.150 --> 00:39.540
vision includes method for acquiring processing analyzing and understanding digital images.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.500
Typically Robert uses a camera to see the world around it.

00:42.600 --> 00:48.840
And this camera will provide the robot with a feed of images that it needs to process so that to extract

00:48.840 --> 00:49.970
useful information.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.890
Image Processing is a very complex and challenging task.

00:52.890 --> 00:58.880
Fortunately in the last 20 years a lot of research has been done and significant advancement took place.

00:58.890 --> 01:04.620
It is not possible to accurately analyze the content of an image and extract useful information out

01:04.620 --> 01:05.030
of it.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.380
The most popular library for computer vision and image processing is open.

01:09.450 --> 01:15.870
It provides a comprehensive set of tools and when it comes to perform complex operation of image processing

01:15.930 --> 01:21.660
and complete revision in real time the objective of this lecture is to get an overview about oppositely

01:21.710 --> 01:23.170
and it's an important feature.

01:23.220 --> 01:29.310
So open Sivy is an open source computer vision Leibert it was released under the BSD license and it

01:29.310 --> 01:31.950
is free for both academic and commercial use.

01:31.950 --> 01:39.720
It supports multiple programming languages namely C++ wife and Java and works under different operating

01:39.720 --> 01:44.940
systems including Windows Mac OS Linux iOS and Android.

01:44.940 --> 01:51.540
It has a strong focus on realtime since it was written C++ and has been optimized open Sivy can perform

01:51.540 --> 01:54.240
a lot of operations related to computer vision.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.280
This is a sample of these operations.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.680
It can do to the image processing.

01:58.680 --> 02:03.530
It can also form image input and output and video input output.

02:03.540 --> 02:10.350
It can read images from files it can read video streams coming from us be cameras from video files it

02:10.350 --> 02:16.300
can perform camera calibration video analysis like motional extract and feature tracking foreground

02:16.380 --> 02:21.960
extraction and nowadays with the advances of much learning and deep learning technology it is possible

02:21.960 --> 02:25.840
to accurately perform object detection and also recognition.

02:25.870 --> 02:32.340
OPEC also supports accelerated computer vision and it has much much more functionalities so let's see

02:32.340 --> 02:35.300
a couple of functionalities that we can use with our PC.

02:35.310 --> 02:40.920
One of the basic functions of a PC is to do image segmentation so image segmentation is the process

02:40.950 --> 02:46.770
of partitioning a digital image into a multiple segments and it is used to locate objects and boundaries

02:46.900 --> 02:48.160
in images.

02:48.180 --> 02:54.220
Another operation is industry shoaling and thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.590
It allows to transform a grayscale image to a binary image.

02:58.590 --> 03:05.580
So the idea here is to take a color as a shot and any color above the threshold will be considered as

03:05.580 --> 03:12.150
white and any color below the threshold will be considered as black so the resulting image will be binary

03:12.450 --> 03:13.920
either black or white.

03:13.950 --> 03:19.710
With the advances of machine learning and deep neural networks it is not possible to detect and they

03:19.710 --> 03:21.940
cognize objects inside an image.

03:21.990 --> 03:28.950
And this technology has promoted a lot of applications like for example autonomous vehicles which rely

03:29.070 --> 03:32.750
on computer vision technique to observe the world around them.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.060
It is also possible to do nice drawing with open Zeevi.

03:36.090 --> 03:41.540
For example it's possible to draw circles lines polygons text and make different shapes.

03:41.610 --> 03:46.350
The practical lecturer we're going to do a little bit of drawing actually the action is also an important

03:46.350 --> 03:48.180
operation in complete revision.

03:48.180 --> 03:54.000
It consists in finding the boundaries of objects within the image and works by detecting discontinuities

03:54.090 --> 03:55.020
in brightness.

03:55.020 --> 03:58.820
Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data structure.

03:58.830 --> 04:05.150
One of the very useful functionalities in AAPC is that to read and write images and videos trips up

04:05.160 --> 04:11.700
and TV it becomes very simple to read an image and load it into a data structure for further processing.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.140
This was a brief background.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.130
An open Zeevi functionalities.

04:15.150 --> 04:18.060
And now let's move to the practical part of this section.
