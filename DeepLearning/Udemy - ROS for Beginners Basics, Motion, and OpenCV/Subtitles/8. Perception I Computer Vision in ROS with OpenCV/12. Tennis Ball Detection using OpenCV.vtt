WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:01.140
OK that's great.

00:01.230 --> 00:04.020
Now I have learned a lot of new functionalities.

00:04.190 --> 00:09.600
And in this video we are going to put everything together in order to develop a colored boy tracking

00:09.660 --> 00:10.350
application.

00:10.440 --> 00:16.500
So in this video we're going to take us and any put an image of a board and then we will identify the

00:16.500 --> 00:19.030
board inside the image using color victory.

00:19.050 --> 00:25.980
And then we will detect the contour of the ball drop its location and surrounding it with an inclosing

00:26.070 --> 00:27.090
circuit.

00:27.120 --> 00:33.010
We're going to apply all the knowledge that you have the three sectors and you've all of these applications.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.070
So the algorithm will be as follows.

00:35.070 --> 00:41.400
Now I think you understand the steps we're going to need an image as an image and then we will use color

00:41.730 --> 00:46.620
coding techniques in order to identify the ball by its color in the image.

00:46.620 --> 00:52.020
So we're going to have kind of a mask where the body will be colored in white and everything will be

00:52.020 --> 00:56.850
colored in black and then we will have a bad image that represent the mass.

00:56.910 --> 01:00.190
We will use it as an input to to detection.

01:00.270 --> 01:02.360
So you will find the control for the ball.

01:02.400 --> 01:08.100
And finally when I don't if I do something with the ball and throw the surrounding circle on the ball

01:08.280 --> 01:11.310
let's see how we can implement this in practice.

01:11.310 --> 01:14.800
Let us now consider the code bolt action fight.

01:14.850 --> 01:19.900
So basically we're going to use some of the functions that we have defined in the previous videos of

01:19.900 --> 01:20.310
course.

01:20.310 --> 01:23.170
First of all we need to read the RG image.

01:23.400 --> 01:30.540
OK some way to use the same function using the previous videos and also the second step is to use this

01:31.050 --> 01:36.300
image and filter the color using the lower band color and the upper bunk on that we will want to use

01:36.300 --> 01:43.250
the same lower bound and upper bound that we find more for the yellow color in the color filtering.

01:43.290 --> 01:49.110
OK so filter color is going to return the mask which is a binary image.

01:49.110 --> 01:54.390
So in this particular case we don't need to use any kind of thresholding techniques because the Range

01:54.390 --> 01:59.940
method that we will use here is going to return a binary image with which we call a mask.

01:59.940 --> 02:06.060
The mask will be used as a binary image input for the get go to method which will be using the pipe

02:06.060 --> 02:10.810
contours method of open CD and then generate all the controls.

02:10.830 --> 02:14.380
So after that we will throw the ball control.

02:14.410 --> 02:18.560
We will use the image a binary image and the controls.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.010
So basically it's the same process that we did before.

02:22.050 --> 02:28.590
The only difference here is that we are going to choose a certain area a threshold for which we're going

02:28.590 --> 02:30.960
to draw the control of the detected object.

02:30.960 --> 02:37.870
So we will see that this condition is very important to eliminate some of the small contorted does not

02:37.920 --> 02:39.920
the present yellow tennis ball.

02:39.990 --> 02:42.450
So this is the arboretum that we are going to follow.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.780
First of all we take the name of the image.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.820
We define the yellow lower bound and the upper bound for the color.

02:48.820 --> 02:54.250
So these are basically the same ball that they have explained in the color of interring lecture then

02:54.260 --> 02:55.280
read the image OK.

02:55.290 --> 03:02.310
So we read the image and generate an image then we will generate the binary image masked by applying

03:02.310 --> 03:10.500
the filter coloring technique calling technique is going to take the image and the upper and lower box

03:10.620 --> 03:17.220
and then we generate the binary image mask then we will use these binary image to generate all the contours

03:17.640 --> 03:21.400
and then we will process the contours to draw only the contour.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.990
But so basically we have used most of the functions.

03:25.990 --> 03:31.900
The only difference is that the dimension just we have made here the area of the contour so let us know

03:31.990 --> 03:33.700
exactly what the detection

03:37.270 --> 03:37.840
OK.

03:37.990 --> 03:43.750
So the bomb detection here is going to be applied to tennis ball one image.

03:43.750 --> 03:44.980
So let's see what happens.

03:45.070 --> 03:47.650
Now this is the tennis club.

03:47.980 --> 03:50.820
Now this is the contour of the tennis ball.

03:50.950 --> 03:55.280
The surrounding circle in red and also into something absurd.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.740
Point which you have to hit here.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.370
I did see the two that circle the black image.

04:01.630 --> 04:02.180
OK.

04:02.290 --> 04:06.000
I just think the small circle of radius 5 feet.

04:06.100 --> 04:11.000
So I was minus one to make it to the center point see X Y and the outer circle here.

04:11.020 --> 04:16.650
This is actually the surrounding sliver of the enclosing circle that you have completed its radius here.

04:16.660 --> 04:22.790
So now let's apply the same code so that if we use your very small value of the radius.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.310
OK so what happens.

04:25.310 --> 04:31.600
So this particular image we don't have any problem because it's clear that you have only one yellow

04:31.600 --> 04:32.590
object that is the point.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.140
So let's look at the images.

04:36.280 --> 04:44.790
So I'm not good on the algorithm for the second ball and is Faltu and it matters.

04:45.040 --> 04:51.340
So you can see we are very very small things because you have a lot of yellow to be the colors which

04:51.430 --> 04:55.680
are like being thrown by Fichter.

04:55.720 --> 05:01.190
So they are kind of considered as detected objects and they are not.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.700
So one of the things we can do here to improve is to change the area.

05:06.990 --> 05:07.450
OK.

05:07.570 --> 05:14.130
We want to create a very large area for example here I'm going to use two thousand and you will see

05:14.150 --> 05:20.040
you know we're going to have much better New any unique.

05:20.270 --> 05:24.130
Most of the very small detected objects.

05:24.360 --> 05:30.590
And of course you can see that we have two circles for the symbol because basically this line that comes

05:30.590 --> 05:33.810
in the middle makes it like they are two separate objects.

05:33.860 --> 05:34.210
OK.

05:34.220 --> 05:39.770
So this is one of the problems of interaction is very sensitive to other colors.

05:40.070 --> 05:44.580
What does you know cause it is an object or part of the direction.

05:44.700 --> 05:52.950
Next I can find some object the left and another object that I would get some kind of edge is that that

05:53.180 --> 05:58.730
because it matches the light of the color but of course maybe what we can do.

05:58.730 --> 06:02.040
So who does it is are the different areas have here.

06:02.080 --> 06:08.860
So I mean you can see that in your little nine three thousand five hundred of these one thousand if

06:09.740 --> 06:15.430
you can get 10000 lose his or her on it's.

06:15.770 --> 06:21.800
So you're causing all the great deal of the area is actually on DVD for a film which to another site

06:21.830 --> 06:28.730
that you said that person or image number three is one number here of course here is that because we

06:28.720 --> 06:38.210
don't have any more than thousand maybe because the image is small here we can start by 100 just to

06:38.210 --> 06:38.750
check.

06:39.090 --> 06:46.010
Is it that spending much time of course here you see the scene the picnic the kind of thing that he

06:46.070 --> 06:47.270
is not worth that much.

06:47.270 --> 06:52.460
And maybe mean to you that it to be the separation and the brightness.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.400
You to have a more active section of his project because of the lighting effects.

06:57.470 --> 07:03.220
We can try another image number for five images of his work.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.260
So same thing here.

07:04.310 --> 07:11.580
You can see when you have a big and important and nice separation the mother's love so much in the area

07:11.600 --> 07:17.500
again to avoid having to duplicate and going towards our edges so you can see there are two areas one

07:17.510 --> 07:22.190
thousand or six thousand in this one the biggest

07:28.490 --> 07:34.630
and again only one of the days when it's applied on less.

07:34.660 --> 07:35.150
Even in

07:42.020 --> 07:46.370
course of there is one one so you can change the area.

07:53.240 --> 08:02.600
He's got a so we can see it's possible to use a for it to be together the contradiction of the objects

08:02.660 --> 08:03.860
based on their colors.

08:03.890 --> 08:09.730
But you can see also that the technique is not very robust but you can do the job very complex use cases.

08:09.740 --> 08:15.110
Of course nowadays there are much more sophisticated techniques in computer vision and image processing

08:15.290 --> 08:21.830
and basically rely on the technique of deep learning and neural networks which is able to classify and

08:21.830 --> 08:25.800
detect Cognos different type of images with high accuracy.

08:25.820 --> 08:32.120
Now having competed with both indiction apply on an image you're willing to extend this program to develop

08:32.350 --> 08:37.650
tennis ball tracking application Turcott it needs to apply on the video.

08:37.670 --> 08:43.330
In this case the board is going to soliton shoulder fired expect the output that you need to do.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.070
OK.

08:44.480 --> 08:51.100
So you need to extend the current code in order to develop an application because it comes in this is

08:51.110 --> 08:51.890
very good image.

08:52.040 --> 08:57.680
This is the image we can see here we had been tracking and designe we use the same code so all you need

08:57.680 --> 09:05.260
to do is to read the video stream and then process the frames one by one and everything you need applied.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.840
The point detection algorithm.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.940
So the assignment will do it in two different ways.

09:09.950 --> 09:17.360
The first way you're going to just read a five minute video file using a PC and process it three by

09:17.360 --> 09:17.690
three.

09:17.690 --> 09:24.170
The second part of the assignment you need to read from the file and publish the phrase using an image

09:24.340 --> 09:29.310
stop it and then you subscribe to the topic and process the frames in the same way.

09:29.360 --> 09:36.710
So in the different the second part of the assignment you need to use those notes to make the conversion

09:36.800 --> 09:40.070
of that image format of the city to us and vice versa.

09:40.100 --> 09:44.300
So you have more details about the assignments and some page following these will be.
