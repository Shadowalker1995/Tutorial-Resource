00:00.460 --> 00:05.740
In this exercise you will develop a simple program that applies the knowledge that you have learned

00:05.800 --> 00:11.620
in previous cultures in order to make global move and also display its position.

00:11.620 --> 00:18.010
So to make things simple we're going to use the turtle simulator and the principle is the same if we

00:18.010 --> 00:19.540
work with any other robot.

00:19.600 --> 00:25.550
So you need first to start the simulator will you start using a scope and then you open another term

00:26.000 --> 00:30.970
and you run a restaurant scene you know.

00:31.150 --> 00:33.460
So you will have the 60 minute.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.660
So now what do you want to do.

00:34.660 --> 00:40.870
We want to develop a program that we publish command to see to make it work for a certain distance and

00:40.930 --> 00:48.090
also that we subscribe to the topic that we provide us with the location of the position.

00:48.340 --> 00:53.530
OK so what you can do YOU CAN OPEN THIS is your goal and get you that S or C finder.

00:53.890 --> 00:57.660
You can create a new Finder that's called assignment.

00:57.730 --> 01:00.480
Folder and then you can create a new file.

01:04.960 --> 01:08.010
Nicolete Robert Moore

01:11.010 --> 01:16.090
topics like so you can develop in Python.

01:16.270 --> 01:19.380
You can also develop in C++.

01:19.690 --> 01:26.190
OK so basically here we need to develop a subscriber in the same program code.

01:26.230 --> 01:39.190
So the same as a subscriber for the topic that we show the location of that object that will be a publisher

01:42.080 --> 01:46.340
to the topic that we make.

01:46.440 --> 02:02.380
But of course the first question is what is the topic of the position and what is the topic that makes

02:03.230 --> 02:04.600
around work.

02:05.470 --> 02:15.090
So we need to find the topic needs of course and the usual way that we can do it is to use race topic.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.310
And yet we have the list of all the topics available.

02:18.610 --> 02:27.350
So it is clear from his lectures that the top post will represent the position of what and the topics

02:27.560 --> 02:28.670
given.

02:29.070 --> 02:31.340
It means command velocity.

02:31.350 --> 02:36.130
It represented the topic that will make the robot move.

02:36.180 --> 02:43.590
So what you can do you can actually take any of these scripts for example I'm going to start from the

02:43.590 --> 02:45.150
listeners.

02:46.090 --> 02:52.000
Let's start from the PALKOT script going just to copy exactly the same.

02:52.110 --> 02:54.320
And then we make necessary changes.

02:54.600 --> 03:01.110
So of course here you need to change the type of the message because in this case you're not going to

03:01.470 --> 03:02.960
publish on the street message.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.170
This was the case from the publisher's subscriber.

03:06.330 --> 03:07.990
Simple applications.

03:08.130 --> 03:14.610
But yet we are going to publish on the topic of the event which is going to contain information about

03:14.610 --> 03:15.220
the speed.

03:15.240 --> 03:20.530
So first thing I can say for example I would choose to be born here instead of the shuttle.

03:20.580 --> 03:26.850
So I would create a publisher that Michelet publisher

03:29.930 --> 03:40.030
OK it's going to be a publisher on the scene the main topic again later on I have to see how the public

03:40.040 --> 03:41.900
side will change this later.

03:41.940 --> 03:47.340
You need to change this later but now the second information yet.

03:47.410 --> 03:53.790
So this topic is not of type string so I need to know what is the type of this topic.

03:53.860 --> 03:59.520
So remember from a previous capture we have used this topic.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.430
OK.

04:00.520 --> 04:07.800
And the rest of the info allows us to find what is the information about this topic and one of the information

04:08.160 --> 04:15.360
it gives as the title of the message that is used by these topics are the top of the message here is

04:15.420 --> 04:17.880
your is just slash twist.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.090
So with is the message of our list.

04:20.320 --> 04:26.970
So this information is useful for us in the cold because now we're going to change this from a statement

04:27.240 --> 04:37.650
with another one from Joe German to him as yes that and it's very important.

04:37.930 --> 04:39.690
So you use the message.

04:39.710 --> 04:44.880
So that message contains the information about the speed of the robot.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.080
Whatever it is the linear speed or the angular speed.

04:48.080 --> 04:53.440
Now the question how what is the content of this message that this is something that you have to know.

04:53.510 --> 05:01.330
So just to give you another hint I remember from the lecture where we talk about intellectual topics

05:01.560 --> 05:09.440
not endless messages we have used the command process and as we showed and then we can apply here the

05:09.440 --> 05:14.560
type of the message that we want to see its content.

05:14.670 --> 05:26.050
So look you know this message it contains two components one that is linear for the linear city and

05:26.050 --> 05:30.410
the second one that is angular for the angular velocity.

05:30.730 --> 05:38.440
And here that has x component y component and z component because any motion occurs in three dimensional

05:38.440 --> 05:39.290
space.

05:40.290 --> 05:45.570
In the case of courtesy you have only two dimensional space X and Y.

05:46.600 --> 05:54.900
But for example if you are flying a drone we also have the z component with respect to the altitude

05:56.730 --> 05:57.230
OK.

05:57.280 --> 06:05.110
So on the other hand we also define the angular velocity that is the rotational speed or rotational

06:05.110 --> 06:11.870
velocity which is also defined in terms of x y and z coordinates.

06:12.220 --> 06:19.960
OK so you must know how to use this information in your Python code in order to define the velocity

06:20.050 --> 06:24.210
of the message for example now I can give you some more hints.

06:24.220 --> 06:24.770
OK.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.560
So let's say we want to find a new velocity message.

06:28.630 --> 06:29.850
So let me find it.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.300
As to its object

06:35.840 --> 06:37.730
this is the way and then what we can do.

06:37.790 --> 06:44.160
So we defined it with object and then inside that was blood.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.970
So we can select linear that x.

06:48.260 --> 06:55.260
For example I want to make the robot move forward so I can assign a value 1.0.

06:55.400 --> 07:00.870
And of course it can do other assignments for the velocity and inner cities.

07:01.100 --> 07:12.460
So I to think about this in order to modify this method then you can make it for example move method

07:16.150 --> 07:16.580
OK.

07:16.680 --> 07:23.620
So you need to make the city changes in order to publish the message correctly.

07:23.760 --> 07:30.540
So try to think about this exercise and later on you can see the solution that presents the you can

07:30.540 --> 07:32.890
watch the video that presents the solution.

07:32.910 --> 07:37.500
Just a final comment before I start working on the exercise.

07:37.740 --> 07:43.800
Do not worry if you feel that you're facing a lot of difficulties because this is normal for new users.

07:43.800 --> 07:48.960
And later on when the explanation we'll be able to understand more and more the concepts.

07:49.170 --> 07:55.470
But before looking at the solutions try your best to solve this exercise and later on have a look at

07:55.470 --> 07:56.800
the tailored solution with your.
