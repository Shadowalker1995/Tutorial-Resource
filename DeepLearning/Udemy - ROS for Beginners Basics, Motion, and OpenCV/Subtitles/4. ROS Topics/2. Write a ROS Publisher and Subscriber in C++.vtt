WEBVTT

00:01.470 --> 00:04.540
So that was a side issue.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.750
OK so welcome to this story in this part of it.

00:07.770 --> 00:11.930
I'm going to explain how to write and publish it just like that.

00:11.950 --> 00:20.560
And this is based on the story on this page and quite like an explanation of how to do it.

00:20.830 --> 00:26.000
And also the different comments for creating a publisher and also a subscriber.

00:26.110 --> 00:32.960
OK so I assume that you have already installed eclipse and contributed to the roster.

00:32.960 --> 00:38.560
I mean otherwise you can use your text editor for writing the code.

00:39.060 --> 00:43.740
OK so this is my package.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.870
OK so we have gotten workspace.

00:47.940 --> 00:50.300
You say you have a building to it or you.

00:50.530 --> 00:56.150
And now we're going to pull out and this is our inside as I see one.

00:56.170 --> 00:58.590
That is the source file folder.

00:58.780 --> 01:09.020
So first of all we need to create a fight and when to call it Torker city be.

01:09.220 --> 01:16.340
So instead of using the same way in I can also create another fight but there is going to be similar

01:17.940 --> 01:30.300
to again in the beginning of the story and especially for our knowledge that the here OK so I have my

01:30.330 --> 01:31.120
toker node

01:35.270 --> 01:37.250
just the flash not the listener.

01:37.550 --> 01:38.590
And both are empty.

01:38.600 --> 01:46.500
So all I need to do now is to write to copy paste the code that is in the tutorial.

01:47.060 --> 01:53.570
So I'm going to copy it from the code here.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.510
So this is the code for

02:00.520 --> 02:03.410
you to see when I'm going to go the list.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.840
Don't see.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.450
OK so this goes on.

02:07.490 --> 02:09.140
These are two files.

02:09.140 --> 02:18.730
So the first thing you need to the Eurozone is to include those library rows that shows that age.

02:18.950 --> 02:26.780
And also here we are going to create a publisher and a subscriber so the publisher publishes the message.

02:26.780 --> 02:31.930
So this is basically how our publisher and subscriber look like.

02:31.970 --> 02:40.250
OK so we know that we publish publish is a chapter topic and this chapter will carry the message of

02:40.250 --> 02:41.270
time.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.390
The end is yes stream.

02:43.400 --> 02:50.600
So just the message but is going to be published by the talker and then it is going to be collected

02:51.110 --> 02:54.540
by this is which is which implemented subscriber.

02:54.780 --> 02:58.500
And of course you know to get in touch with the Master.

02:58.720 --> 03:04.790
So the talk is that it is a partnership to know it would be publishing the chuck of topic and that is

03:04.780 --> 03:10.450
that we are looking for a chapter we can be contacted for what is first.

03:10.670 --> 03:22.130
OK so now for doing this I mean to do that message seemed the message that these messages are just message

03:23.180 --> 03:29.810
and by the way you need to make sure that you are getting Maylis.

03:30.140 --> 03:36.660
So you find this the package it is yes will get here.

03:36.770 --> 03:39.240
And also you added bonus.

03:39.850 --> 03:48.430
So we can look at the debunkers used the back gate and it depends on the city and its all standard messages.

03:48.710 --> 03:52.730
We provide dependencies for the project.

03:52.790 --> 03:58.610
We are working on the spec and should be looking at the target and also the same thing in the package

03:58.610 --> 04:03.600
that ex-inmate we have to make sure that CDMA is yes.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.410
Okay.

04:04.530 --> 04:11.150
Is it the panacea for both running the program and also building operation.

04:11.390 --> 04:15.470
You have to make sure that we are.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.030
Okay.

04:18.270 --> 04:27.720
So that we know will be the first thing you need to initialize the not using gross.

04:28.330 --> 04:28.950
Okay.

04:29.030 --> 04:36.930
And you give to this knowing this case is going to be called Torker because this is not going to policy.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.550
So its a talker.

04:38.910 --> 04:39.440
Okay.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.960
So when and you talk.

04:43.140 --> 04:50.070
And then the second step is to create in order to have that and this would represent the references

04:50.080 --> 04:54.450
side to and you know create of it.

04:54.750 --> 05:06.960
So this is done through laws no glass but we provide one object and the you know that will be used for

05:07.230 --> 05:12.030
creating publishers and also for creating subscribers.

05:12.520 --> 05:20.460
So the next step is to create a publisher because we patent the talkers so the doctor is a publisher.

05:20.640 --> 05:29.640
We use Ross publisher of glass to create a publisher object code to check the publishing OK and if not

05:29.990 --> 05:32.470
then you have to read it here.

05:32.980 --> 05:44.070
And then one of the methods is us gay advertisers love to advertise and you told me whose name is chatter

05:44.740 --> 05:48.420
and the message is I see I see.

05:48.820 --> 05:49.990
Yes.

05:50.540 --> 05:57.990
And this is the buffer size how many messages can be actually accumulated before being processed or

05:58.550 --> 06:04.850
up to ten thousand OK.

06:06.310 --> 06:13.800
So so far we cannot stop publishing anything but just we are a new publisher.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.040
OK so here we divide the Lubavitchers and this is the start of a comeback.

06:19.210 --> 06:23.830
This is the center for the topic.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.360
Almost nothing is published yet.

06:26.860 --> 06:27.800
OK.

06:28.030 --> 06:32.870
So we are way to use these objects either very selective on the part of the best.

06:33.280 --> 06:45.410
OK so to get some DNA on that we can do this using the grocery class and we can see that this could

06:45.840 --> 06:48.130
be and ugly.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.370
And we are willing to create one message for.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.600
So one last question and this is the number of messages.

06:54.610 --> 07:02.390
Second if I want them to be specific and Jiji to 1 0 or if I want 100 message for a second that can

07:02.400 --> 07:02.950
change it too.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.940
So this is the number of messages per second.

07:05.980 --> 07:09.080
So in this case I'm going to change it to one second.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.330
That's what I see.

07:10.420 --> 07:16.740
So I'm going to make the publisher publishing messages each one second and of course you can choose

07:16.880 --> 07:20.130
this one if you want to post these two seconds.

07:20.410 --> 07:28.550
You can put this up on my sister second so this case will have one major and one message each 10 seconds.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.600
So I'm going to make it one.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.070
OK.

07:33.310 --> 07:37.220
Now we are going to make this look for the publisher.

07:37.220 --> 07:48.030
So why GROSZ OK this is easy to see on the side of the usual press control-C So this is better than

07:48.030 --> 07:50.860
me because well to this is.

07:51.270 --> 08:00.580
If you make less OK so you can actually enter the program by placing Control-C to see later on this.

08:01.270 --> 08:05.150
How to stop the problem when he is writing.

08:05.680 --> 08:10.910
OK so now everything is only read first put me into my search to be published.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.920
So I'm going to create a message of Pepsi.

08:14.120 --> 08:18.200
OK so this is a rare sight in Pakistan.

08:18.200 --> 08:30.100
The message is and that this industry this is C++ will put him to work.

08:30.210 --> 08:35.930
I will become fine in the message that I have created.

08:35.990 --> 08:45.480
MC So you think the sort of attributes that you think are so amazing those data is going to echo to

08:45.480 --> 08:47.350
the masses that I have formulated

08:50.600 --> 08:53.220
and then I'm going to make this what I read.

08:53.400 --> 09:00.710
So I polish person so that with the message that is published and.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.690
So this is the key point here.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.170
This is where the message will be published.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.710
So this is message.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.850
So we are going to call check the publisher

09:13.850 --> 09:22.420
and then we are going to call the Publish method to publish method to put the message of type some of

09:22.420 --> 09:27.580
that is yes of course the site was already specified here.

09:27.990 --> 09:33.200
So if you put any of message on the front that is going to be a compilation error.

09:33.570 --> 09:40.200
So obviously you think that the publisher has taken a stand on the street.

09:40.440 --> 09:45.120
This is the same type of the message that you find here.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.740
OK so not everything is really fine.

09:49.830 --> 09:59.230
I know to make all those months so this is actually it allows us to send all the messages that are in

09:59.230 --> 10:07.720
the buffer so publish will put the message in about her only when she was a biscop then the message

10:07.720 --> 10:15.150
would be processed and would be effectively Poche that we are going to try to stop what would happen.

10:15.520 --> 10:23.930
OK and finally I'm going to make a small sip of one second before publishing the next message that we

10:23.980 --> 10:24.790
might encounter.

10:24.790 --> 10:31.270
I repeat all the process so here we are going to publish one message.

10:31.360 --> 10:37.630
Steps three which are in work because we should be reminded each time.

10:38.040 --> 10:38.850
OK.

10:39.040 --> 10:43.900
And finally this is going to be printed in the terminal.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.760
And finally zero because this is the arm.

10:47.020 --> 10:55.590
So this is a very simple program OK to present a model what anybody should come across later on we are

10:55.600 --> 10:59.030
going to make some other stories and get all that messages.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.400
But the police say no.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.620
So again it may all to us to say right now.

11:06.710 --> 11:08.410
Not long go.

11:08.530 --> 11:13.180
First of all I need to make a small contribution to make this OK.

11:13.630 --> 11:24.280
I need to make a see so that the new goal is compact because if you don't get it site you don't have.

11:24.860 --> 11:33.190
So now I'm going to make it work space and they can actually make.

11:34.060 --> 11:34.910
OK.

11:36.240 --> 11:42.340
Now does that make me look at you decompiled the newly created Torker.

11:42.690 --> 11:46.520
Because it was not it was not.

11:46.530 --> 11:55.360
So this is another not that is you know for example finding any any kind of conclusion ever.

11:56.050 --> 11:59.010
Ok if I make any competition or on purpose.

11:59.040 --> 12:04.490
We can say that the company is not going to make another go at it.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.840
Nothing has changed.

12:06.200 --> 12:15.710
So enough to make this getting more space to make this fight.

12:15.910 --> 12:25.360
And finally I one executable so I'm just going to come in here to I'm going to ask you for one of the

12:25.380 --> 12:26.820
talker.

12:27.450 --> 12:32.510
Again this is actually the same this is also explained in the story here.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.010
OK.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.980
You told me to execute it works.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.830
So.

12:41.500 --> 12:45.300
So give me exactly what we call.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.250
OK.

12:47.490 --> 12:56.180
Final question of the it as such so is the name of the file that we have created that is seen by the

12:57.530 --> 13:00.840
that you need to do.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.600
This is a good one.

13:02.600 --> 13:09.390
That is the talk you get with vocabularies so you can compile fine.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.100
Otherwise it is just not happening.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.310
This is my message but in this particular case.

13:16.310 --> 13:19.130
We don't have any comment at the moment.

13:19.160 --> 13:30.760
Now if I can and get a key made of course the effect of this or message of this should be detected.

13:32.560 --> 13:32.980
OK.

13:33.050 --> 13:37.070
So there is a letter here it says it is used not the clock.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.780
This is just because you have to define it twice.

13:40.010 --> 13:45.670
So now I'm going to make it right then.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.770
Let me combine again.

13:47.870 --> 13:53.800
So now consider when it's created and is called Tavor.

13:54.350 --> 14:03.240
So we are almost done now the next step is to create to run this executable.

14:04.030 --> 14:04.820
OK.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.280
We're going to drop.

14:06.310 --> 14:15.760
So this is a good will is inside the workspace and inside the building of all your baggage.

14:16.290 --> 14:27.600
So I'm going to make a fuss first of all to run Roscoe OK so I can but no I don't trust Mr. OK.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.820
The second step would be to

14:33.450 --> 14:38.160
the you know that you got me to select from the name of the packages.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.240
OK.

14:39.360 --> 14:45.000
And then I can find what they have told you already and you can make a dog or

14:49.290 --> 14:51.640
you can see know everything works fine.

14:52.010 --> 14:56.920
It's think the same message I published the word message.

14:57.020 --> 14:57.520
OK.

14:57.510 --> 15:02.690
Exactly the same way that you didn't hear in be.

15:02.790 --> 15:07.140
If I compiled again so I haven't change.

15:08.370 --> 15:11.760
I don't need his help to get the letter.

15:12.100 --> 15:17.950
Working capital letters so you can search and you can also visit here.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.370
So I was Doherty's.

15:20.510 --> 15:21.660
So all I need to do.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.980
I'm going to go back again.

15:26.090 --> 15:33.710
Using the mailing engine you talk.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.840
OK.

15:36.220 --> 15:46.380
Now I can say you guys you know the changes affect me makes it her the.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.280
OK.

15:48.410 --> 15:53.160
So then on the machine they can actually verify this.

15:53.390 --> 16:00.550
So you can listen to any published topic using Russ..

16:00.550 --> 16:10.790
So first of all stopping a call or stopping this so I can find my chatter topping up.

16:10.820 --> 16:17.700
I can't believe I mentioned above the topic was topic useful.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.110
OK.

16:19.190 --> 16:31.310
So it's a type of message history case you know was partially the topic of this role for no suspect.

16:31.430 --> 16:33.050
All we want to know.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.910
OK now I'm going to stop over.

16:35.940 --> 16:37.870
I want to see.

16:38.420 --> 16:43.950
OK so when I see it it's white because you mean the OK.

16:44.050 --> 16:44.620
OK.

16:44.840 --> 16:51.890
OK so why he's not going to run forever OK.

16:52.160 --> 17:03.630
So if I make those totally again find the title because I know how close the toker know I'm going to

17:03.650 --> 17:12.970
look bad could not again gay and can't get the gist big comes back ok.

17:13.180 --> 17:21.630
I know I can also make big people I would love to listen to his message.

17:24.580 --> 17:32.520
So you can see how that is published we can we can write the content of that message so we can see here

17:32.520 --> 17:35.020
they can see it this way.

17:35.050 --> 17:42.050
This is the beauty of the message and this is the message that the Spanish word.

17:43.330 --> 17:47.230
So everything works fine for the talker.

17:47.740 --> 17:57.670
OK for substracting the talk using something but also to the subscriber for the title.

17:57.880 --> 18:05.500
So now this is not a fight that you can be OK.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.030
No.

18:07.780 --> 18:08.800
OK.

18:09.280 --> 18:09.750
OK.

18:09.770 --> 18:22.640
So again we do all those cases the fantasy is also the story of sodomizes package.

18:23.370 --> 18:31.910
OK so stuff we're going to create this this which we subscribe to the Chucko topic.

18:32.670 --> 18:33.560
OK.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.220
That's very simple.

18:35.560 --> 18:41.800
So I would say the only function we first need to know as we did with the doctor and this is you are

18:41.800 --> 18:45.140
going to call it initialising.

18:45.520 --> 18:53.550
We know know the reference you see when we get to the doctor at least this time will be.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.030
No but you can.

18:56.110 --> 18:59.370
And finally I want to get a subscriber.

18:59.560 --> 19:06.450
So the subscriber is the class but it will allow me to stop.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.770
And no this is not how we get here.

19:10.120 --> 19:16.450
The subscriber will take the first name of the topic its structure.

19:16.750 --> 19:23.640
So I have a chapter on this topic and they have to tell you the name of the book to be subscribe to.

19:23.830 --> 19:30.050
This is the buffer size how many messages will be back for that process.

19:30.350 --> 19:38.530
You can put a number if you really low number one if you have two messages that come to the bottom one

19:38.530 --> 19:40.660
of them of course.

19:40.660 --> 19:51.570
And finally OK we are able to create a threat OK for processing any incoming message.

19:51.610 --> 20:00.390
So this is a subscriber OK and for subscriber Amos's the process it must be processed right.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.090
So we are able to create a function that we would call a callback.

20:04.360 --> 20:10.210
This callback will be automatically executed whenever a new message.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.480
OK all the chatter got me will we.

20:13.650 --> 20:16.450
Let me see what I see.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.000
Message the callback.

20:19.100 --> 20:24.050
So I tried to pull back but to keep it any other way.

20:24.460 --> 20:34.360
So automatically executed OK whenever a message see here or the name of the message of the message that

20:34.360 --> 20:38.550
would be executed and that I need to find that and I thought OK.

20:38.560 --> 20:42.730
So it's a voice of code that it takes on my part.

20:42.970 --> 20:46.180
That is the message OK.

20:46.190 --> 20:52.170
So I pointer to the message stream.

20:52.180 --> 20:57.860
OK so this cost of the optics is also wanted for the message.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.000
OK.

20:59.110 --> 21:03.930
And finally Whenever I just speak you know I don't have too much processing here.

21:04.150 --> 21:12.440
But of course what other topics you need to process you need to process it in different ways.

21:12.470 --> 21:24.770
You can just to stay the message or at least say I heard person ask you this is my system is very simple.

21:25.300 --> 21:29.140
And of course you should not forget to me cruel to me.

21:29.980 --> 21:38.960
This is supposed to be months once we the process the first one time.

21:39.130 --> 21:46.150
And trust me and I'm just processing all of the incoming messages in the callbacks.

21:46.150 --> 21:47.390
This is a different source.

21:47.510 --> 21:54.530
Once it stays on for about time that the back of incoming message has to be processed.

21:54.730 --> 22:02.690
And once we make the that any messages callback functions so that's it.

22:02.890 --> 22:11.090
Now the reason that I can say we are going to execute it of course I need to come to my house you make

22:11.090 --> 22:18.230
this copy from your quantification.

22:18.360 --> 22:24.200
So this is this is another this is the name of the note I'm going to get.

22:24.780 --> 22:29.160
And this is the name of the file that they have created.

22:29.170 --> 22:32.230
This not add to the list.

22:32.380 --> 22:33.020
OK.

22:33.180 --> 22:39.960
In the other way I'm going to be back to this.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.680
Let's talk about Mr..

22:42.930 --> 22:47.270
So you know no to all the letters.

22:47.310 --> 22:48.680
That's very simple.

22:49.130 --> 22:49.670
OK.

22:49.680 --> 22:59.930
So the next step would be to say to go by you know to make workspace.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.310
This could mean

23:14.110 --> 23:18.870
for some time now we can see there is a new executable that is generated.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.370
It's the listener.

23:21.030 --> 23:27.120
OK so fine I can go around my my both nodes.

23:27.940 --> 23:38.150
So let us run.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.230
OK but before I knew the.

23:42.270 --> 23:46.930
Let's let's run this.

23:47.950 --> 23:49.000
OK.

23:49.420 --> 23:58.060
Now there is nothing that you discover is never into that one because there is no.

23:58.280 --> 24:08.210
So I love the daughter OK because if for a public message I heard the word too.

24:08.220 --> 24:11.180
So this class would be executed.

24:11.640 --> 24:16.180
OK so you can see this is

24:19.620 --> 24:20.860
a new message.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.070
OK.

24:28.390 --> 24:32.150
So his message started to go to YouTube and so on.

24:32.410 --> 24:33.220
So if I saw

24:36.570 --> 24:44.220
day of the last Mrs. 4:37 and he said is so it works fine.

24:44.330 --> 24:50.750
So I'm sure if I want to get the frequency with the son one message each to say it's going to click

24:50.750 --> 24:52.200
into one.

24:52.910 --> 24:53.630
OK.

24:53.830 --> 24:54.860
Twenty two point five

24:58.100 --> 25:02.340
I'm going to make another me.

25:03.590 --> 25:15.250
So I told her so now are two seconds and you can see that such prejudice is missing.

25:16.010 --> 25:18.890
OK so now it's second messages generated.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.050
Because I have just seen the talker.

25:23.370 --> 25:23.850
OK.

25:23.910 --> 25:34.030
So what happens when I subscribed for any message Mrs. OK the callback for the call button function

25:34.080 --> 25:35.220
to be executed.

25:35.420 --> 25:42.640
But this is going to be using grazin force us to eat please.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.920
It's going to be this message.

25:45.210 --> 25:45.690
OK.

25:45.700 --> 25:55.570
I've heard that the message is this is this is the message you see that this is the easy to see because

25:55.570 --> 25:59.260
you can see here she works that much from

26:06.250 --> 26:06.760
OK

26:11.530 --> 26:20.580
so or the publisher already told you just before finishing you can do the same.

26:20.840 --> 26:25.800
And listen to music by for whatever reason that is you see.

26:26.090 --> 26:29.470
This is the piping version.

26:29.970 --> 26:30.660
OK.

26:30.690 --> 26:35.560
So this is a person that you don't eat pork roast by the roots.

26:35.910 --> 26:36.940
OK.

26:36.960 --> 26:43.530
And also the Wall Street message from some of the messages package.

26:44.010 --> 26:53.490
And then we have to find a new function that is called Dr. OK so you start when you create a perfect

26:54.250 --> 26:55.690
type checker.

26:56.270 --> 27:01.120
Ok off topic for the type of message you see the one that you put in.

27:01.130 --> 27:06.700
Yes I did you say it's only for text messages.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.060
There usually is no.

27:09.590 --> 27:19.380
OK so one of the differences is that the publisher is using frostbite 5 class not with the handler.

27:19.410 --> 27:23.050
It's been banned here.

27:23.680 --> 27:28.770
And that you should you know again the CROSSFIRE does it not.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.250
OK.

27:30.420 --> 27:38.840
You know here it started we are going to publish the message is certainly so who the heck is going to

27:38.850 --> 27:43.030
be one one second.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.110
Why.

27:44.300 --> 27:44.860
OK.

27:44.990 --> 27:46.100
Look would.

27:46.310 --> 27:53.630
This is equivalent to OK in the US we create Heyworth message.

27:54.220 --> 27:55.310
OK.

27:55.700 --> 28:08.050
By the time and finally we are going to read the message published see for some time.

28:08.210 --> 28:11.100
According to the plan here.

28:11.120 --> 28:16.130
So he got my message for I said so this is all about the document.

28:16.190 --> 28:20.050
You can see that in the US version.

28:20.080 --> 28:30.550
It was the same one that you find the main function to execute this method call and that's it.

28:30.560 --> 28:37.350
So the contract is when you use file for finding your notes.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.880
You don't need to add anything.

28:38.910 --> 28:47.570
You could make these so all you need to do day is to go to

28:51.120 --> 28:58.360
the father he'll have the skills for that and make sure that you're not executable.

28:58.680 --> 29:11.660
So usually you can do this if you say age old 7 7 7 8 x the name of an object is OK.

29:11.940 --> 29:24.010
So you have to have an executable if it is not executable so this scholar and if want to if you want

29:24.010 --> 29:37.460
to know who that's going to make us slum and then looking at the two men talking about.

29:37.600 --> 29:44.630
So this is the name of the executable Python code.

29:44.710 --> 29:46.010
What is it.

29:46.440 --> 29:51.510
You can see here is the time of day.

29:52.080 --> 29:52.940
OK.

29:52.960 --> 30:02.200
Now I can on my subscriber that I really see this plus start OK and you can see it works pretty much

30:02.270 --> 30:07.330
finer than I am and it's not easy.

30:07.340 --> 30:10.750
Let's let's and it works pretty much

30:13.960 --> 30:16.840
the same way you can buy it.

30:16.980 --> 30:24.850
So we import those foreign imports the message from standard messages can and we are willing to find

30:24.850 --> 30:35.550
them is all need to do is initialize a node and then create the subscriber of course both of them using

30:35.550 --> 30:37.590
crossfire.

30:37.950 --> 30:44.300
So this is the table the note that this is the name of the topic chapter which you can find in the main

30:44.300 --> 30:44.990
method.

30:45.090 --> 30:48.000
We just need pullouts the listener.

30:48.180 --> 30:52.900
And of course you need to define that because it's called that OK.

30:53.100 --> 30:54.620
This is the callback.

30:54.640 --> 31:02.930
Let the child find out what you can keep and so that will be a starter.

31:02.940 --> 31:05.500
And finally we believe.

31:05.650 --> 31:09.870
You can see there is no pointers to that in the garden.

31:10.190 --> 31:19.230
But actually the rule of thumb here is when you want to use like us weeks maybe bison would be more

31:19.330 --> 31:20.240
appropriate.

31:20.520 --> 31:27.330
But if you want to make like larger programs in this case that's more appropriate.

31:27.450 --> 31:37.890
But it's up to you to decide what they want to use and or six plus letters so we can execute.

31:38.290 --> 31:44.720
We can also use it but it takes a good five years.

31:45.010 --> 31:48.970
It doesn't mean it's not going to pop.

31:49.090 --> 31:56.510
It works like I got out of here like I'm told for the nursery

31:59.980 --> 32:02.180
on the end of the season.

32:02.340 --> 32:05.250
It works fine.

32:06.530 --> 32:12.150
So I hope that was helpful for you.

32:12.150 --> 32:14.250
Thank you for your attention this year.

32:14.270 --> 32:15.190
In the next story is.
