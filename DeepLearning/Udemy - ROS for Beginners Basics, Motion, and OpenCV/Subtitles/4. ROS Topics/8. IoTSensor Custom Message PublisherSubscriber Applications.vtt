00:00.590 --> 00:07.380
It this video present a publisher subscriber application that communicate with each other using the

00:07.410 --> 00:09.480
ideas and so that's the message.

00:09.480 --> 00:14.370
So first of all I would like to highlight that there was a spelling error as the hour was missing for

00:14.430 --> 00:15.450
the temperature.

00:15.510 --> 00:23.250
I have other art to fix spelling error and also I have combined to then using that make to generate

00:23.250 --> 00:25.330
the correct answer message.

00:25.370 --> 00:25.760
OK.

00:25.800 --> 00:33.120
So as I mentioned before we can use the US and the zip show that the BE sensor to see the content of

00:33.120 --> 00:34.080
the message.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.040
Now we will create an application that uses the ID sensor message.

00:38.040 --> 00:43.740
It will be very similar to the application with all of the threats that the message that will be exchanged

00:43.830 --> 00:47.700
between the talker and the listener will be the same message.

00:47.700 --> 00:52.310
So first let's consider the fire and the sensor potential that pipe.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.860
This is the equivalent of the Talgarth not by application.

00:55.860 --> 01:02.370
So if you remember it'll go by we have an important message then we can either the publisher on the

01:02.460 --> 01:05.130
other topic and we use this message type.

01:05.250 --> 01:08.400
Finally we keep sending a message every second.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.340
So we do exactly the same.

01:10.560 --> 01:16.110
The only difference is that instead of publishing this new message we're going to publish an instant

01:16.190 --> 01:16.870
message.

01:16.900 --> 01:25.440
So when you say you know we want to import the disaster message from the package was Sasha's CPB and

01:25.580 --> 01:31.940
that image is you white because the fire is located it the your folder.

01:31.980 --> 01:34.690
This is the essential CTP package.

01:34.770 --> 01:38.420
And this is the embassy folder with the IDs and so image is located.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.080
So we import from that folder.

01:41.470 --> 01:43.900
Russ essentially CVP This is the name of the package.

01:43.910 --> 01:48.380
And this is the folder where the sensor message type is located.

01:48.660 --> 01:52.410
And then we create a publisher in the same way we did with the Torker.

01:52.500 --> 01:56.900
So instead of using the shuttle to become we to call the topic the sensor topic.

01:56.940 --> 01:59.730
And here we really get the message type of the sensor.

01:59.790 --> 02:03.870
And you find the crew size as before then we initialize the node.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.070
This is the name of the node.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.810
I had the sensor publisher of.

02:07.290 --> 02:10.110
And we will use the same plate of one second.

02:10.110 --> 02:13.500
So this means we want to send one message per second.

02:13.650 --> 02:17.810
And inside the way you will want to find out the sensor object.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.830
And then we repopulate with somebody.

02:19.830 --> 02:22.380
So I'm going to assign an ID equal to one.

02:22.560 --> 02:30.300
I'm going to assign a name equal to Tea Party for example and then we'll assign some values to the temperature

02:30.380 --> 02:31.790
of to humility.

02:31.860 --> 02:37.770
So as you can see here I am assigning some random values for the temperature using random that random

02:37.860 --> 02:42.310
multiplied by some constant Just plus plus minus 2 and something for the immediate.

02:42.330 --> 02:46.520
This is just emulate that we receive kind of random values from Sassenach.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.150
This is just for emulation.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.260
And then I'm going to display the coyote sensor object.

02:52.260 --> 02:54.400
And finally we publish this one.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.990
So let's try this example.

02:58.390 --> 03:04.450
Let me ask you tell me what was the one we need to start a telescope.

03:06.410 --> 03:18.620
OK let me turn that neuron was one of those essential CVB and then I think I see I don't find any.

03:18.850 --> 03:22.000
And you know with all that it was defined here.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.250
The SIRC of the

03:29.580 --> 03:30.670
would be sunset.

03:30.950 --> 03:36.670
So the problem is that when you create a fire in fire by the fire it is not executable.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.530
So we need to make this fight.

03:38.570 --> 03:41.050
You could put in order to be able to run it.

03:41.110 --> 03:46.560
There are different ways on how we can make it so you can come on the fire and click on the properties.

03:46.700 --> 03:51.620
You go to the permissions and then you click on the love executing file as a program.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.490
So in this case Usie is going to appear for us.

03:56.510 --> 04:01.160
This is the sensor publisher.

04:01.180 --> 04:05.140
We can also say for subscribing to tie up we do that later.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.520
So let's start this one.

04:06.680 --> 04:12.620
So as you can see now it's publishing the value of the ID and with some random batches of the temperature.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.980
And do you mean as you can see because users topic this year.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.300
So you'll find we will find that we have discussed that topic.

04:20.450 --> 04:21.960
You can use lots of nice.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.820
We will find that we have an uncensored publisher.

04:24.970 --> 04:27.070
No one that you to.

04:27.260 --> 04:28.580
We can use the rest of.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.910
Go.

04:32.040 --> 04:37.530
And then the name of the top that the or underscore topic

04:40.450 --> 04:43.340
again and you are able to listen to that topic.

04:43.510 --> 04:49.870
So now we get to be a subscriber in the same way that we did for the listener not to listen to this

04:49.870 --> 04:51.900
incoming information.

04:51.970 --> 05:06.320
We can also do stop the evil eye and the censor topic OK.

05:06.410 --> 05:11.480
So as that type is essentially is sensible This is the type of the message.

05:11.610 --> 05:12.920
Now we have only one.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.360
That is the publisher.

05:14.350 --> 05:16.660
No that's not the subscriber.

05:16.820 --> 05:20.630
So the subscriber is going to be in the same way as we can for the listener.

05:20.650 --> 05:26.700
Let me put up the misconduct by the PI We created the subscriber object on the same topic of the Torker

05:26.900 --> 05:32.630
and then we defined the type of the message it was week and now out is to become the answer and then

05:32.690 --> 05:37.410
a chapter back when we do the same strategy in the absence of subscriber time.

05:37.610 --> 05:43.020
So we define subscriber in this case is going to subscribe to the same topic that was published by the

05:43.490 --> 05:49.970
publisher that is called the sense of topic and this is the name of the message type so to impart the

05:49.970 --> 05:51.730
same message that from here.

05:51.880 --> 05:56.280
And when you find a callback function I'm going to call the callback function I will be sensor callback

05:57.230 --> 06:00.350
and it does answer a callback when will receive the message.

06:00.370 --> 06:06.820
And simply going to print the message that you only date and see person for the ID person.

06:06.970 --> 06:13.180
As for the need at some point for the temperature and person point to where you are immediately.

06:13.550 --> 06:14.000
OK.

06:14.030 --> 06:15.190
So lets make it work.

06:16.990 --> 06:30.030
Camisole is the Bangi now on women and going out run our subscriber Clow restaurant was a Sanchez CVB.

06:30.480 --> 06:35.670
So I only see people initially because the subscriber is not me.

06:35.700 --> 06:42.960
Its a good one so I can do the same way I can go here and go to propertys admission and executing the

06:42.960 --> 06:52.440
program file as a program or otherwise we can go to the package to the file itself.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.630
Slush a busy one.

06:56.730 --> 07:04.720
OK I think you answered so we can try as much as we can see this is non-degreed one is a good one but

07:04.720 --> 07:12.600
its not the case or the ID sensor subscriber that like what we can do we can mix the HMO and the permissions

07:12.620 --> 07:13.620
with 777.

07:13.620 --> 07:18.460
So is it enough to really drive and execute the fight.

07:18.570 --> 07:22.460
And then we will do this as a subscriber to buy.

07:22.860 --> 07:28.420
And then the find becomes basically what we can see now its in the green color now.

07:28.590 --> 07:35.510
Now I am able to execute the subscriber growth Rose essentially CPB.

07:35.970 --> 07:44.220
And then the sensor subscriber that by and you'll see it's going to show the data that the CDC every

07:44.220 --> 07:54.220
time new Iraqi data receive what is published 24 83 for 83 it's published.

07:54.460 --> 08:04.790
Again we can do also now to of the info on the topic the central topic.

08:04.920 --> 08:10.560
So we can see we have a substracted publisher that is sort publish a note and a subscriber that is out

08:10.650 --> 08:12.610
to censor subscribers.

08:13.110 --> 08:18.990
And you can see now we have a complete application based on the customers message that we have created

08:18.990 --> 08:21.070
that is the AG sponsored message.

08:21.180 --> 08:25.100
And of course you can do the same for any other type of message that you want to create.

08:25.110 --> 08:26.740
It depends on the application.

08:26.760 --> 08:32.290
So here I made it very simple example using some ideas of the device.

08:32.400 --> 08:38.880
But of course it can be applied to any hardware or any device that you want to get any information from

08:38.880 --> 08:41.580
me and plug it into a custom Cross message.
