00:00.140 --> 00:05.670
In this video I demonstrate how to add new customers message and how to make sure that the message is

00:05.880 --> 00:08.030
effectively added and can be used by.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.190
So let's get started.

00:10.200 --> 00:16.440
Our objective is to develop an idea some sort of cast a message that contains three attributes the id

00:16.500 --> 00:19.190
the name the temperature and humidity.

00:19.260 --> 00:24.300
We have already presented the steps in the previous culture and now we start implementing that.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.570
First let's get to our rust package.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.810
This is cooking workspace.

00:28.920 --> 00:33.180
Archie was essentially besotted you is the name of the roast package.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.320
Where are we going to implement the roast message.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.280
First we need to create an image folder inside the rest package route Finder which is this one

00:45.480 --> 00:51.330
make sure that the location is growth package for that and not any other insight or example if you create

00:51.330 --> 00:57.780
the finder here or at the site of this father is not going to be visible and the father will not be

00:57.790 --> 01:00.280
recognized and the message cannot be created.

01:00.300 --> 01:05.800
So it must be created Navarros package Felger then we create our message.

01:06.030 --> 01:08.270
So let's create a new text file.

01:08.380 --> 01:09.990
I just answered that and it's

01:13.170 --> 01:15.540
a good document.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.080
So that means.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.520
And let me open the whole project into line.

01:20.540 --> 01:24.440
Are any of your choices in the business to cope now.

01:24.540 --> 01:32.730
Inside the embassy father we have the sun's energy which is now country and we create our custom message.

01:32.730 --> 01:34.800
We add different fields to the fight.

01:34.830 --> 01:38.340
So first of all we had the idea which is an integer.

01:38.340 --> 01:46.320
So I would use for 30 to post the name of type string with the temperature of type 32

01:49.010 --> 01:54.770
and also will add the humidity of type 132 as well.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.540
Now the message file is created you can refer to look emendations page.

02:02.540 --> 02:08.720
We can go to that or slash energy if you want to have more information about the different primitive

02:08.720 --> 02:15.880
types available for you to create customers messages and to find the attributes of various messages.

02:15.890 --> 02:23.810
In our case we have used 32 in 32 and string but there are a bunch of different other types that can

02:23.840 --> 02:25.010
also be used.

02:25.010 --> 02:31.340
So after getting the Iraqi message the next step is to update the dependencies in both Pakistan ex-inmate

02:31.670 --> 02:33.260
and semi-gloss that the XTi.

02:33.350 --> 02:36.010
So we can divide these two fives over here.

02:36.140 --> 02:42.920
We start by package that amount and we have to make sure that we have been depan message generation.

02:43.070 --> 02:44.190
It's already there.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.090
And also you have an execution the band message intact.

02:48.280 --> 02:54.050
So these are the two lines that are important to generate messages with us.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.320
We also will update the dependencies in the C Make list.

02:57.320 --> 03:07.960
So first of all in the final package section we need to add a message generation as a component that

03:08.050 --> 03:13.680
we do our message fifes and we're going to come with this section your

03:16.480 --> 03:17.090
right.

03:17.150 --> 03:20.710
The correct name of our message right so our message fighting squad.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.780
We censor the image.

03:26.180 --> 03:31.910
OK so this is threatening to be responsible for adding this fight to the rest of the system.

03:31.970 --> 03:36.330
In addition in that package we need to add another dependency.

03:36.590 --> 03:38.890
That is the message I'm dying.

03:39.590 --> 03:46.250
And finally make sure the generic message dependency standard emphasis is also activated here.

03:46.520 --> 03:51.520
Now you have done all the required configurations and we are ready to integrate our message.

03:51.620 --> 03:58.630
Now are we to combine our backwards so that the message is generated we open a terminal and then we

03:58.630 --> 04:01.240
go to look at the workspace.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.660
And then you have to compile it using that can make.

04:05.710 --> 04:10.130
So you can see that our message is now generated on the sensor imagery.

04:10.390 --> 04:17.520
And if you want to make sure that the message is correctly generated and we can do Russ MSCE joke I

04:17.580 --> 04:19.190
won't be censored.

04:20.200 --> 04:25.580
So he is going to provide us all information about the disaster message.

04:25.720 --> 04:32.470
It is located in the back and are most essential CBP and the title is IOTAs has said and this is the

04:32.470 --> 04:39.580
content it has to do is the ID Street need both temperature and humidity.

04:39.580 --> 04:44.680
So these are the four people that have defined our idea sounds good and it's fine.

04:44.920 --> 04:51.130
So a big step we have already generated a message that can be used either step sister in the next video

04:51.250 --> 04:57.360
I'm going to demonstrate how we use this message to communicate between two Snoad.

04:57.460 --> 04:57.910
Why not.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.970
That is the publisher of this message and the second note.

05:01.010 --> 05:04.350
Well as a subscriber to as I said a message.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.640
So let's see how it works.
