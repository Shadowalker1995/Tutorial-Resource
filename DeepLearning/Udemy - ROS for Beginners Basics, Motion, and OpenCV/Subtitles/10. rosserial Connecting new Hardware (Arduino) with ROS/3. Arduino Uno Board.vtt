00:00.260 --> 00:05.400
In this video I'm going to present the main properties of the argument on to a book or you know you

00:05.400 --> 00:11.490
know is a microcontroller board based on a bit of mega 328 microcontroller.

00:11.580 --> 00:19.770
It also has other components such as crystal oscillator operating at 16 megahertz frequency of communication

00:19.770 --> 00:27.360
through us part a voltage regulator to regulate voltage at three or five parts and many different input

00:27.450 --> 00:28.720
output parts.

00:29.080 --> 00:36.590
Arduino has 14 digital input output pins out of which six can be used as P.W. and outputs.

00:36.600 --> 00:44.430
It also has six analog input is ID from zero to five about a bottle of Jack that receives an input voltage

00:44.490 --> 00:49.490
of 12 volt and circuit serial programming header and a reset button.

00:50.680 --> 00:57.640
There are two types of sensors that can be used with Arduino on board some sensors provide digital data

00:57.730 --> 01:03.490
and some other sensors provide analog data digital data sensors should be connected to the board through

01:03.490 --> 01:09.780
the digital input output pins and analog sensors must be connected to the board with the analog bits.

01:09.890 --> 01:15.820
Everything has a number and this number allows to identify the signal being in the programming environment

01:15.880 --> 01:18.520
through which the data will be received from the sensor.

01:18.520 --> 01:24.160
This makes it so easy to interface with any sensor in the programming environment what you observe in

01:24.160 --> 01:29.860
the top is called the Arduino based shield the shield can be mounted on top of the arguido board to

01:29.860 --> 01:37.320
be able to connect sensors through it to be able to connect sensor to it using four pin connectors.

01:37.360 --> 01:43.090
This is the Arduino based shield Vol. 2 and this is the 4 pin connector and you can observe that the

01:43.090 --> 01:45.190
base shield has several inputs.

01:45.190 --> 01:51.760
We have digital inputs the two the three 4 and to the eight we have to see inputs and also you have

01:51.860 --> 01:52.990
analog inputs.

01:53.140 --> 01:59.770
It's possible also to configure the base shield whether to operate at 5 volt or three vote using this

01:59.890 --> 02:00.540
switch.

02:00.550 --> 02:04.810
This is the reset button here and it has also a u r interface.

02:04.810 --> 02:10.150
The base is very useful to connect multiple sensors to the Arduino book in the next video.

02:10.330 --> 02:16.900
I will try a sample program using the Arduino ID and demonstrate how simple it is to develop a program

02:16.900 --> 02:18.340
that interfaces with sensors.
