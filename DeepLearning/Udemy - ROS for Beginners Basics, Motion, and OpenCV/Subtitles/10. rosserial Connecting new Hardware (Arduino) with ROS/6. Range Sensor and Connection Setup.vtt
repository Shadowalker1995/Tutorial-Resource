00:00.120 --> 00:05.130
Know that you had you started arguing an integrated development environment we are ready to start developing

00:05.220 --> 00:06.350
our first program.

00:06.420 --> 00:14.070
And we are going to use the ultrasonic ring sensor in this example and ultrasonic sensor devices allow

00:14.070 --> 00:18.940
us to estimate that age to obstacles using ultrasound signals.

00:19.010 --> 00:26.960
Let us first understand how an ultrasonic sensor works that we create sensor has two users which are

00:27.020 --> 00:30.990
microphones used to send and receive pulse signals.

00:31.160 --> 00:38.440
The first transducer will send a pulse signal by sending a low signal first which is zero then high

00:38.530 --> 00:42.950
that that is one and then a low signal that is zero.

00:43.130 --> 00:49.440
And when the signal is an obstacle it is going to bounce back and be received by the microphone.

00:49.730 --> 00:56.240
The sensor will then estimate the distance obstacle by measuring the duration between sending the high

00:56.240 --> 01:04.190
pulse signal and receiving it back by the receiver the time calculated is the down time to the obstacle

01:04.490 --> 01:06.150
which will be divided by two.

01:06.200 --> 01:12.430
We'll have the actualisation in one direction and then it will be multiplied by the speed of the sun

01:12.500 --> 01:16.520
in the air which is three hundred forty meters per second.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.270
And that's all the process is repeated and ranges are measured periodically every certain number of

01:23.270 --> 01:25.020
milliseconds.

01:25.160 --> 01:32.390
Sensors can be used in many applications such as presence to detect intruders lover for container for

01:32.390 --> 01:36.950
example smart containers or what the level measurement position and distance.

01:36.980 --> 01:40.390
They are also called proximity sensors.

01:40.420 --> 01:47.120
I walk also to attract your attention that there are different types of sensors in the market.

01:47.120 --> 01:53.270
The first type is the h g s r 0 4 sensor which has four points.

01:53.300 --> 02:00.590
The left beam is four pounds of light Vcc is for the ground and the two the best in the middle are four

02:00.590 --> 02:01.570
to six months.

02:01.700 --> 02:08.990
The three beam is responsible for something the height bounced signal whereas the copy is responsible

02:08.990 --> 02:10.730
for the reception of the echo.

02:10.730 --> 02:13.870
After that it bounces back against an obstacle.

02:14.020 --> 02:20.480
The order may change from one manufacturers to an other but in total we have four means where two different

02:20.480 --> 02:26.190
signal pins are used one for sending the pulse and the second is for receiving the bus.

02:26.210 --> 02:29.430
The second type is the parallax being sensor.

02:29.450 --> 02:36.080
It has only three beats one for this is the one for the ground and only one bill for CNN.

02:36.110 --> 02:43.810
It's good to see the same signal being used for both being the pulse and also receiving the echo.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.650
So it will take between two states.

02:46.670 --> 02:51.130
We will be using this type of sensor in our demonstration and implementation.

02:51.140 --> 02:58.400
And you will figure out later on how the same being can be used for sending and receiving on the right

02:58.400 --> 03:03.280
side of the slide the exact sensor that you will be using in the implementation.

03:03.280 --> 03:10.490
It's show but you can observe it it has for this although the biggies being like sensor like this one.

03:10.730 --> 03:16.350
So we can observe that it has the ground been and will be on the left side.

03:16.490 --> 03:20.640
And then it has the NCP that is not used for any signal.

03:20.750 --> 03:27.020
And you have healed the sick in on the right side which is used for both sending the pulse and receiving

03:27.080 --> 03:28.170
it back.

03:28.170 --> 03:35.730
We'll be connecting this being to let his input output pin number seven for sending and receiving pulses.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.950
Let us see how to connect the sensors to the arm you know what.

03:39.020 --> 03:44.280
So basically the connection schema will be as follows you'll have a nutritionist some sort of the brain

03:44.290 --> 03:46.600
be connected to you know work.

03:46.610 --> 03:52.760
So as you can see we connected to the fibroid power to the ground and the signal will be connected to

03:52.990 --> 03:53.570
being here.

03:53.570 --> 03:58.700
So we're going to try pin number so that you can find more details about this sunset which is called

03:58.790 --> 04:05.890
The Big sensor in this website or we know that CCDs flush toilets flush speak.

04:06.110 --> 04:12.140
So if you open up and use the ex-president and this other require devices that we use in this experiment

04:12.590 --> 04:21.480
all you have an answer or one when we have an I.V. machine that you are going to use to collect the

04:21.480 --> 04:22.140
sensor.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.540
It is going to be touched.

04:24.720 --> 04:30.010
You know when you have a sensor.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.560
OK.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.030
This is the warping connector.

04:35.960 --> 04:42.880
They use the cable to connect the board to the laptop.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.900
So this is the wrestlings so that we are going to use.

04:45.940 --> 04:49.940
So as you can see it has four beams OK and one foot down.

04:50.010 --> 04:52.050
That is the one on the left side.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.340
Then you see them and see which one is not.

04:55.390 --> 05:02.110
And then you have the signal being OK so the signal ping is going to sound and echo signal and then

05:02.200 --> 05:09.630
it receives back a response that will be used correctly to estimate the range to an obstacle using the

05:09.640 --> 05:12.520
song saying.

05:12.690 --> 05:19.220
OK so in order to make the connection first of all we need to put the sheet on the Adreno or by this

05:22.790 --> 05:31.510
going to get the seat of the unknown and then use the 4 pin connector.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.820
And you like it here.

05:33.980 --> 05:37.420
The sensor so you can see the wire.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.140
OK.

05:38.190 --> 05:39.610
Response to the signal.

05:40.060 --> 05:48.700
And that is why Autocar response to the VCAT and the black wire corresponds to the ground.

05:50.070 --> 05:54.600
And then you're going to the number seven.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.410
What are the connections on here in DC.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.050
Because this is a digital sensor so I'm going to put it here.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.370
Nice.

06:03.510 --> 06:04.220
OK.

06:04.350 --> 06:11.540
And you can see what this wired the yellow wire to the server.

06:11.890 --> 06:13.380
Ok so this is the.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.530
But will be used for the system.

06:16.860 --> 06:24.570
We will see later on how to use this in the program but only the sensor estimate the distance to an

06:24.600 --> 06:25.860
optical.

06:25.890 --> 06:35.040
And finally we need to get that border locked up like this.
