00:00.430 --> 00:04.700
Not you to slow the rest of your libraries and this will be done in two steps.

00:04.700 --> 00:10.590
First of all you need to install those libraries into the robot operating system itself and then we

00:10.590 --> 00:14.720
need to generate get those libraries for the agreeno in that system.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.620
OK so let's see how it works.

00:16.620 --> 00:23.130
So this is the reference page for the rest of the protocol in tweaky which is available in the web site.

00:23.130 --> 00:30.750
We trust that Oracle slush said you can hear more information about it even if in the specification

00:30.750 --> 00:32.200
of the protocol itself.

00:32.220 --> 00:38.700
And also you can access that to Tony page for the whole city of you know what we say in the following

00:38.700 --> 00:39.290
videos.

00:39.300 --> 00:42.310
So the first thing you need to do is to install Arduino.

00:42.390 --> 00:46.690
And this was also to install a serious software.

00:46.740 --> 00:51.980
So as you mentioned the first step is to use Rosetti into this workstation.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.030
And this is done using sudo.

00:54.040 --> 01:00.030
It didn't get installed Ross and neither version are safe.

01:00.240 --> 01:05.940
Actually I have already installed my system so I think it's going to happen but if you don't have it

01:05.940 --> 01:10.980
on your system it's going to install it and then you have to also install Rosetti.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.260
It's a great plan.

01:14.670 --> 01:17.740
I have also installed in my system.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.310
So after doing this installation we are able to have access to the package or serial Python.

01:23.310 --> 01:29.400
We should present the server in the workstation site that is going to intercept messages coming from

01:29.400 --> 01:30.710
the embedded system.

01:30.720 --> 01:36.350
Now the second step is actually to generate libraries for the embedded system.

01:36.360 --> 01:41.910
Now looking at the Adreno find that if you go to libraries OK these are the available levers for the

01:41.910 --> 01:42.250
moment.

01:42.250 --> 01:48.150
We don't have any library related to us so we may first read this literally and then put it inside the

01:48.300 --> 01:49.500
Lebanese folder.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.160
So the way to do it would be to go to the folder then the libraries.

01:55.960 --> 02:00.490
Make sure that we don't have any reason to keep it here.

02:00.610 --> 02:04.440
We don't have any library for the moment that we can use reverse.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.100
OK let's run for another.

02:07.100 --> 02:11.720
Let me know if you are on the rise eco system.

02:12.080 --> 02:19.670
And then it release for that we run a restaurant or city and Adreno make libraries that buy it and you

02:19.690 --> 02:27.870
have to specify the location so that Miss the current location then it's going to generate for us all

02:28.020 --> 02:32.430
the libraries needed to program with us into another we know what.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.930
So let's look now at the library's folder.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.350
Now we have a new folder that was added.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.600
It's called trust.

02:38.710 --> 02:44.520
And this seemed to represent the whole roast system adapted or the original platform.

02:44.570 --> 02:50.890
OK so you can see now these are the headers files for the operating system and you can have different

02:50.890 --> 02:52.300
type of messages.

02:52.400 --> 02:59.190
It is supposedly arguido like Turkel but the messages are to see the notes of different packages which

02:59.210 --> 03:02.370
are not adapted for agreeno platform.

03:02.670 --> 03:09.610
Ok by doing so now we have Rowse already integrated into the ID of Avino and now it is possible to develop

03:09.840 --> 03:13.190
a program adapted for the agreeno platform.

03:13.200 --> 03:21.960
Now we can argue no and use your examples we have examples integrated for robot operating system and

03:21.970 --> 03:25.130
in the next video I'm going to start with the Hillward example.

03:25.130 --> 03:31.940
So at this stage we have everything that not to develop plus program for the argument platform and then

03:32.270 --> 03:35.640
connected to a workstation in the next video.

03:35.690 --> 03:41.720
I'm going to show how we can upload those programs to you know how to run them using less in the workstation.
