In this video I'm going to present the Blink application and how to write a ROS subscriber in Arduino.

1
00:06.030 --> 00:07.280
So let's see how it works.

2
00:07.290 --> 00:12.660
I'm going now to present the blink example which shows step by step on how to write a subscriber.

3
00:12.660 --> 00:16.300
So in this tutorial we have presented how to create a publisher.

4
00:16.350 --> 00:21.080
You can also create the subscriber inside a rosserial arduino board.

5
00:21.330 --> 00:27.710
So let's open the sketch on the blink application which creates a subscriber and here in the same way we're

6
00:27.720 --> 00:35.940
going to include ROS libraries you know here and the subscriber is a family and the message here is when

7
00:35.940 --> 00:38.710
you subscribe to a topic that is called Tuggle.

8
00:38.740 --> 00:46.410
And so whenever an empty is seen on this topic in this case the callback function message is going to

9
00:46.410 --> 00:47.440
be executed.

10
00:47.670 --> 00:50.930
And what it will do is really just to leave that.

11
00:51.210 --> 00:54.340
OK so the lead is looking in the number 13.

12
00:54.360 --> 01:00.290
I've been on the board and this operation is going actually to talk all the lead sometimes and sometimes.

13
01:00.330 --> 01:04.050
So let's upload this sketch into the our universe.

14
01:04.430 --> 01:06.790
Ok you should never have this kind of error.

15
01:06.870 --> 01:09.010
It's better that you reset your connections.

16
01:09.060 --> 01:10.900
So I'm going to close everything.

17
01:11.000 --> 01:12.390
Set the connection.

18
01:18.910 --> 01:20.700
I start to get the idea you know.

19
01:22.610 --> 01:25.120
Not open the link of negation again.

20
01:25.150 --> 01:27.040
Let me see it up close.

21
01:27.080 --> 01:29.540
You have to check your number.

22
01:29.570 --> 01:32.890
So no because you know what I have to be committed again.

23
01:32.970 --> 01:33.930
I see.

24
01:34.270 --> 01:43.730
Now it gives us the white one so I'm going to send them this one and then upload it to get uploaded.

25
01:44.600 --> 01:46.640
So let's do the same steps.

26
01:46.690 --> 01:52.510
Ran LASKOFF and then we will run a city in person city.

27
01:52.510 --> 01:53.190
No.

28
01:53.500 --> 01:55.190
So now part has changed.

29
01:55.330 --> 02:01.650
Instead of just be if you like it's MDO it is now and that's that's that's the way it is.

30
02:01.750 --> 02:02.260
Wow.

31
02:04.010 --> 02:04.430
OK.

32
02:04.440 --> 02:10.310
He's not going there because he's not interested in that but he's a subscriber on the topic so that

33
02:12.250 --> 02:14.350
we can use those.

34
02:15.050 --> 02:26.290
But the thing is we have talking now Toben and even so are going to use the commander to stop the part

35
02:26.760 --> 02:29.900
of the boot to send the message.

36
02:30.130 --> 02:32.040
This is OK.

37
02:32.540 --> 02:43.070
Now when I'm with this message the reader or the lead you know me and switch on it you can see that.

38
02:43.670 --> 02:49.130
Now if I were to say message again going to see no switch.

39
02:49.440 --> 02:56.160
So I guess it's possible that some of those for months in order to switch off and off the net and you

40
02:56.160 --> 03:04.820
can see how that is a function BP Rusticus even workstation and also the system that is running on a

41
03:05.250 --> 03:06.460
platform is.

42
03:06.960 --> 03:17.190
You have the subscriber you will put that when there is any message coming up in the lead which is on

43
03:17.670 --> 03:18.300
and off.

44
03:18.300 --> 03:26.700
So the next video I'm going to how Prospero a Them program in Reno to read the information coming from

45
03:27.120 --> 03:31.350
the sensor of this information into those systems.

46
03:31.470 --> 03:32.370
And the workstation.
