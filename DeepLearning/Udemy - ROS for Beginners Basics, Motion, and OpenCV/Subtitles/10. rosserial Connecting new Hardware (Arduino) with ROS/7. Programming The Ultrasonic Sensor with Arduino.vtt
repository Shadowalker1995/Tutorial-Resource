WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:05.670
So after making the connection you are now ready to program the Arduino or know for the ultrasonic cleaner

00:05.700 --> 00:06.400
sensor.

00:06.450 --> 00:10.840
And this is actually the base that we use as a reference for our program.

00:10.890 --> 00:13.230
We're going to use the same program as here.

00:13.230 --> 00:18.790
So let me open the I don't mean I'm going to the Adina for lower than that slushed Adreno

00:22.980 --> 00:32.280
we can find the example of that would try something sensor here so we can go to sensor being days so

00:32.280 --> 00:36.690
this is the same coding that we can find in the story which can be found here.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.650
Sounds hurt big.

00:39.960 --> 00:45.090
So this being that I end up the a program that you be using now.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.270
So let's see the structure of the program.

00:47.610 --> 00:50.290
First of all the find a concept for the pin number.

00:50.310 --> 00:55.860
And here in this example you have used the number 7 and then initialize the serial communication using

00:55.910 --> 00:59.080
said maybe underspecified here the boundary.

00:59.310 --> 01:06.570
So this is going to specify what is the speed of the data that will be exchanged with a report between

01:06.570 --> 01:09.270
the Arduino board and also the computer.

01:09.270 --> 01:15.280
In this case the mod. is 9600 after initializing our program.

01:15.330 --> 01:20.010
Then we go to the loop method which we implement the logic of the application.

01:20.070 --> 01:26.910
First of all the signal being is going to be configured to be used as an output B because he's going

01:26.910 --> 01:29.790
to send the ship signal.

01:30.290 --> 01:30.710
OK.

01:30.720 --> 01:37.410
And this is not the structure of the signal we're going to send low pulse then high pass and then a

01:37.410 --> 01:39.740
low pulse after sending the signal.

01:39.810 --> 01:43.430
The pin is going to be converted into that input mode.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.440
So the same pin is used to read the signon from the pig and the high pulse whose duration is the time

01:49.500 --> 01:55.240
in microsecond from the sending of the pig to the reception of its echo of an object.

01:55.260 --> 02:01.450
So these high signal is going to bounce back and then will be captured by the echo transducer.

02:01.470 --> 02:08.240
And based on this we are going to estimate the duration which is on the time from Sunday behind us and

02:08.260 --> 02:14.280
to the time of receiving back behind Echo and using that duration we can then estimate the distance

02:14.370 --> 02:16.840
either in inches or in centimeters.

02:16.850 --> 02:22.410
OK so here you can find that are two methods one that converts a microseconds into inches.

02:22.500 --> 02:28.530
And this is done by dividing the duration by 74 and 2 and you can also estimate the distance in something

02:28.530 --> 02:30.870
metres by dividing it by 29.

02:30.990 --> 02:36.600
And so for example here this is because of the speed of the sound is three hundred forty meters per

02:36.600 --> 02:39.890
second or 29 microsecond person meter.

02:39.900 --> 02:45.870
So the big travels up and back so defined the distance of objects we take half of the distance traveled

02:46.050 --> 02:49.560
because that is the time when it goes and it don't back.

02:49.590 --> 02:53.850
So this is why we need to divide by two here and here as well.

02:53.970 --> 02:58.600
And these value 29 is related to the speed of the sound in the air.

02:58.710 --> 02:59.990
Everything is fine.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.010
We first compiled the program.

03:02.010 --> 03:05.700
So now we can see that the compilation is done.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.770
And finally we will upload the program

03:10.350 --> 03:11.700
into the you know what.

03:11.910 --> 03:16.340
So you can see here that we have an error message that it cannot find that device.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.680
Did you write ACM what so.

03:18.750 --> 03:24.360
First of all you have to make sure that we know what is connected to you or your bent operating system

03:24.360 --> 03:24.950
machine.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.820
You have to select the board being on so you can see that are different types of parts in our case.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.280
As you all know.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.200
So we have to select this one.

03:34.260 --> 03:39.870
And the second step is to find the parts are here we couldn't find any port for the Arduino on board.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.310
I'm going to reconnect it again

03:44.340 --> 03:44.760
and then.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.800
So I have this connection box and there is a connector Lileks.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.090
Los Angeles.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.340
Can go back to work.

03:51.390 --> 03:55.560
And now I would find that they are doing what's disconnected on the part slash.

03:55.650 --> 03:56.970
Slash did you right.

03:57.000 --> 03:57.960
AC zero.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.250
So this is Arduino.

03:59.320 --> 04:06.470
You know I have to select this one and this time I'm able to upload the program now to get on board.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.770
As you can see

04:11.620 --> 04:13.820
this is uploaded.

04:13.880 --> 04:20.960
Now we can use a monitor in order to see the messages received from the our you know all about your

04:21.010 --> 04:25.720
radios so that print is going to print them to the city monitor.

04:25.820 --> 04:29.290
So as you can see here this is the increase sensor.

04:29.420 --> 04:35.260
And you can observe as a person the sensor This is going to decrease.

04:35.410 --> 04:44.540
OK so 9 9 centimeters 6 centimeters 4 centimeters something that isn't not going to work our way on

04:44.540 --> 04:45.200
the sensor.

04:45.230 --> 04:53.030
And then you can see that the distance to increase that we can see in our sensor is working pretty much

04:53.030 --> 04:58.370
fight and is now finding and estimating the distance to the obstacle.

04:58.370 --> 05:05.260
Of course now we are able actually to read the values within the city in winter but we cannot actually

05:05.290 --> 05:07.150
read the patterns from us.

05:07.200 --> 05:16.220
And this is why we use to get information from the laser sensor that it enters your system so you can

05:16.220 --> 05:20.490
see all of the above is not from that system.

05:20.510 --> 05:24.420
There is no connection between them in the next video.

05:24.410 --> 05:32.030
I'm going to show you how to use a cell you want to comment about the hospital system is receiving this

05:32.090 --> 05:35.680
information given in the sensor as the voice messages.
