00:00.250 --> 00:06.810
This video I'm going to show how to install the army integrated development environment so that later

00:06.810 --> 00:12.420
on we will use it in order that up a small program when we know the process is very simple.

00:12.420 --> 00:17.300
This is the lead of the Web site from where you can download the Arduino the software.

00:17.550 --> 00:23.910
As already mentioned is a cross-platform so you can install it on any operating system including Mac

00:23.910 --> 00:27.140
operating system Windows and Ubuntu.

00:27.410 --> 00:33.060
Yes we are going to work with our we know and integrate with the US so we need to install it in our

00:33.180 --> 00:36.220
Ubuntu operating system where rust is started.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.290
So let's see how that works.

00:38.400 --> 00:44.850
Now I move back to my Ubuntu machine where I have just installed and this is the software download website.

00:44.880 --> 00:50.700
You can download the latest version and currently the latest version is Arduino one point eight point

00:50.700 --> 00:51.510
six.

00:51.690 --> 00:56.430
So you can download it for a different operating system whether it is for Windows Mac operating system

00:56.610 --> 00:58.840
and Linux operating system.

00:58.860 --> 01:06.810
So in our case we're going to choose Linux 64 bits just need to click here and then download the software

01:09.210 --> 01:12.770
and file would be saved into the downloads folder.

01:14.320 --> 01:19.270
Takes a little bit of time to install and now it's done

01:23.550 --> 01:31.570
you can go download folder and then what you need to do is just extract the zip package like this and

01:31.570 --> 01:35.380
finally copy the package into the home directory.

01:35.380 --> 01:41.730
Now I have it here to the home that actually it's called Adreno one point a point x.

01:42.340 --> 01:44.570
Ok this is in the source folder.

01:44.830 --> 01:51.550
OK we have the original executable that you are going to use to start a new integrated development environment

01:51.870 --> 01:54.330
and you have different other folders.

01:54.370 --> 01:55.490
So it is for them.

01:55.510 --> 02:01.350
It has several examples that we can access from the Integrated Development Environment.

02:01.690 --> 02:07.450
Also here we have some libraries and this is where you are going to have the libraries related to or

02:07.570 --> 02:10.300
about operating system at a later stage.

02:10.370 --> 02:11.540
Not to start.

02:11.740 --> 02:17.340
When you open a terminal and then you need to go to the other window.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.990
OK so here we have our window and you can see that we have to execute a plan.

02:21.010 --> 02:26.980
So all you need to do is to do that slash Arduino and even open.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.940
So these are different programs so we can go here.

02:35.470 --> 02:39.020
The examples are these are examples that they have shown to you before.

02:39.070 --> 02:42.340
OK you can add one examples.

02:42.370 --> 02:49.000
So the next video I'm going to show you how to write a program for a neutral range sensor.
