00:00.200 --> 00:05.700
I am professor and any school but I'm glad to be an instructor in this course about Robert operating

00:05.700 --> 00:06.240
system.

00:06.330 --> 00:10.900
I'm currently working as a professor in computer science in Princeton University in Saudi Arabia.

00:10.950 --> 00:16.830
I'm also the director of R&amp;D department in Goetic robotics in China and also a senior researcher in

00:16.830 --> 00:18.850
the sister Research Center in Portugal.

00:18.990 --> 00:23.810
I have been working in a lot of projects in both university and industry.

00:23.870 --> 00:29.460
I'm also building the robotics and Internet of Things where we conduct a lot of research about the integration

00:29.460 --> 00:33.410
of robots into the Internet of Things and into the clouds.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.990
I'm also an ACM distinguished speaker.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.860
You learn more about my biography.

00:37.860 --> 00:39.990
You can refer to my Web page.

00:40.020 --> 00:44.440
I try to be as you did it you did as a slash or Cuba.

00:44.640 --> 00:50.460
I have been also teaching robotics and drones for several years at the university and I have written

00:50.550 --> 00:56.790
a lot of tutorials and developed several courses from Robert operating system and robotics.

00:56.790 --> 01:03.030
I have also developed conducting training program certificates for robot operating system which has

01:03.120 --> 01:08.330
attracted a lot of audience and contributed to promoting the learning of ros.

01:08.340 --> 01:14.940
I'm now glad to put my experience at the hands of your students to teach them about this very exciting

01:14.940 --> 01:22.020
technology robot operating system and help them overcome their difficulties in their learning process.

01:22.980 --> 01:28.320
I have had several projects around the house and one of the projects that we have recently reported

01:28.650 --> 01:35.190
is the integration of office enabled robots into the Internet so that we allow the users to monitor

01:35.250 --> 01:37.270
and control robots over the Internet.

01:37.320 --> 01:43.200
And for this we have developed the Rosling protocol for us and it is protocol that allows the communication

01:43.200 --> 01:51.240
between us enable the robots and also users so that a cloud server or a user can easily monitor and

01:51.240 --> 01:54.060
control the robot anywhere in any time.

01:54.060 --> 01:59.610
So the Resnik protocol it leverages is the use of cloud computing and Internet of Things or the control

01:59.670 --> 02:06.030
and monitoring for us enabling robots and other contribution is also the control of drones over the

02:06.030 --> 02:11.910
internet for which we have the bottom the drone map which is a cloud based drone and drama management

02:11.910 --> 02:13.380
system over the internet.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.650
I have also authored and edited several books.

02:16.660 --> 02:23.220
So currently I have three volumes on Prabhat operating system books The Complete Reference Vol. 1 vol.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.390
2 and Vol. 3 which will publish it.

02:25.390 --> 02:30.930
Briger you have also recently a new book on Robert Plant and Corporation one of the contributions of

02:30.930 --> 02:36.630
this book is the integration of new planets into robot operating system.

02:36.810 --> 02:41.200
So this was a brief overview about myself and the hope that we enjoy.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.350
Of course on the robot operating system.
