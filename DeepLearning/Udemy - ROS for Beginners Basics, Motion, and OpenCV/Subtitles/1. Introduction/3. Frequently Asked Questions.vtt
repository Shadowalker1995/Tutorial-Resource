It was one of the earliest I mean in this video I'm going to provide answers and responses to some frequently

00:08.310 --> 00:11.330
asked questions that they have been receiving from the students.

00:11.340 --> 00:17.310
So I wanted to clarify a few issues that may come to you whenever you are following the Cox one of the

00:17.310 --> 00:21.600
comments that they have received a couple of times is that the font size in some of the videos is very

00:21.600 --> 00:23.220
small and hardly readable.

00:23.220 --> 00:28.380
Actually this is probably the case of some of the videos in the beginning because the first the videos

00:28.380 --> 00:31.920
that they have recorded were not designed to work on small screens.

00:31.950 --> 00:37.890
And after some time I figured out that some of these videos are not very well readable on small screens

00:37.890 --> 00:40.130
like smartphones or tablets.

00:40.170 --> 00:46.980
However for later videos like from resurfaces on CD laser scanners and all the other videos I have increased

00:47.100 --> 00:52.680
significantly the font size all the videos should be readable even if you look at them in a smartphone

00:52.770 --> 00:53.910
or tablet.

00:53.910 --> 00:59.510
So what they would recommend if you find some of the videos with the small font size you can use a large

00:59.520 --> 01:00.150
screen.

01:00.240 --> 01:06.590
And in this case we'll be able to clearly read and follow the videos independently from the FONTES.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.080
OK.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.810
In some cases I shouldn't say that the topic was fast.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.860
It's not very common.

01:10.860 --> 01:13.660
Probably a few students just claimed that.

01:13.720 --> 01:20.370
I actually think that whenever I record the video I try to reduce the video by removing some silences

01:20.400 --> 01:23.300
and removing some some useless parts.

01:23.340 --> 01:28.320
So probably in some cases it might look that the topic is fact but I do believe that most of the reviews

01:28.400 --> 01:30.530
they are presented in the good books.

01:30.660 --> 01:36.600
I hope also received the question that that is not taught in how to install on Windows basically can

01:36.660 --> 01:38.050
only be installed on your belt.

01:38.100 --> 01:44.010
But also if you work on a Windows machine you can install a virtual machine like for example VM workstation

01:44.040 --> 01:49.260
or virtual box and then you can install Ubuntu on top of that and then you can install trust on Ubuntu

01:49.260 --> 01:50.250
on the virtual machine.

01:50.250 --> 01:56.460
I have a video that explains some recommendations and guidelines on how to install virtual machines

01:56.550 --> 01:58.800
how to download them from their websites and so on.

01:58.860 --> 02:03.850
I didn't make specific video for Windows but they have made a specific video for installing virtual

02:03.870 --> 02:04.590
machine on that.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.540
And the process is exactly the same.

02:06.690 --> 02:11.310
So you can just follow the same process instead of downloading VM fusion that they have used in the

02:11.310 --> 02:12.480
Mac operating system.

02:12.480 --> 02:18.300
You can't just don't logical box or you can download VM workstation and you can follow exactly the same

02:18.300 --> 02:21.930
steps that they have you presenting in the Mac OS operating system.
