Hi welcome to the course or for beginners basics motion and up in theory Ross is the main development

00:08.370 --> 00:10.770
framework for robotics applications.

00:10.800 --> 00:18.720
However it takes a long time for a new user to grasp well the concepts and understand well the internal

00:18.720 --> 00:22.080
mechanics of for us due to the steep learning curve.

00:22.380 --> 00:29.070
I'm glad to put this course at the heart of the beginners users learners in the pragmatic and focused

00:29.070 --> 00:29.730
fashion.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.210
Step by step with a clear roadmap.

00:32.280 --> 00:39.010
This course is a result of several years of experience of working and developing programs with us.

00:39.030 --> 00:45.390
I am a new school professor in computer science and I have a long experience developing programs we

00:45.390 --> 00:50.020
trust in both academia and industry at academic level.

00:50.370 --> 00:57.030
I have taught Ross for university students and this allowed me to understand well the problems that

00:57.030 --> 01:02.000
make the students struggle to learn the ropes and develop solutions to overcome them.

01:02.160 --> 01:08.660
I have also developed training programs for learning Gruss in the context of research projects.

01:08.910 --> 01:16.590
I developed several softwares for us including the Rosling protocol that integrates robots with cloud

01:16.680 --> 01:18.510
and Internet of Things.

01:18.560 --> 01:25.620
The my boat service Robert for home and office usage I've plugins for robot operating system and maturer

01:25.830 --> 01:27.870
systems for us enabling robots.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.750
Much more industrial level.

01:30.750 --> 01:37.230
I have been leading the research and development department of Gaeltacht robotics and we have developed

01:37.320 --> 01:40.800
aerial and ground robots platform all around us.

01:40.830 --> 01:47.160
I am also the founder and the maintainer of Gatwick it you portering and I have good many books on race

01:47.190 --> 01:56.160
with Springer based on my experience in numerous user has to learn concepts and system then learn how

01:56.160 --> 02:03.810
to make a robot move in the environment and also learn how Robert sees the environment as such.

02:03.810 --> 02:07.060
The course is organized in three main parts.

02:07.170 --> 02:15.450
The first part deals with various concepts including gross computation graphs such as Rush notes topics

02:15.540 --> 02:23.920
messages services actually and chose how to develop simple programs for us in both C++ and Python.

02:24.090 --> 02:28.880
The Course also gives new users how to install trust on their system.

02:28.890 --> 02:35.210
Once these concepts are understood the second part deals with basic robot motion.

02:35.310 --> 02:41.520
We build a simple application using the turtle sim simulator that makes the robot moves in different

02:41.520 --> 02:45.830
trajectories and simulates a robot meaning application.

02:45.840 --> 02:53.340
This part illustrates how to manage a Ross project in C++ and how to decompose a large problem into

02:53.370 --> 02:58.050
a subset of problems that need to develop into a global solution.

02:58.050 --> 03:05.450
In addition it will make you understand Robert kinematics and how to control a robot motion mirrorless.

03:05.490 --> 03:12.600
The first part of the course deals with Robert perception and presents an overview on up and see which

03:12.600 --> 03:18.770
is the most powerful library to develop computer vision and image processing and what it is we get most

03:18.780 --> 03:25.620
with several programs of open Zeevi on Russ and show how to bridge between rows image format and up

03:25.630 --> 03:27.290
is Zeevi image format.

03:27.330 --> 03:33.930
The Course also provides many hints on activities so that the student can assess his understanding of

03:33.930 --> 03:36.190
the concepts presented in the lectures.

03:36.240 --> 03:43.320
At the end viscose provides a comprehensive overview of ros and allows a new user to quickly find his

03:43.320 --> 03:46.920
path into developing his own project with us.

03:46.920 --> 03:47.950
Welcome to the course.
