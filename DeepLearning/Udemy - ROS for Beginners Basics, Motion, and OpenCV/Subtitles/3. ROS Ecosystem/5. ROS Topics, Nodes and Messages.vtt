00:00.150 --> 00:07.580
This letter that was said I'm one of hummable you this year you are going to explain those notes and

00:07.580 --> 00:08.850
those topics.

00:08.850 --> 00:15.210
So first of all you want to be able to work with Ross view the first to run cross-court as the media.

00:15.510 --> 00:18.630
So now it is around that you can see in this.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.700
Know now.

00:22.350 --> 00:23.960
So after the first story.

00:24.130 --> 00:27.870
So I have to explain what is wrong score and why it is important.

00:28.230 --> 00:39.050
OK so we can see not the least parthenos of stuff as you know at least

00:43.010 --> 00:45.710
so often awful of.

00:45.990 --> 00:53.460
Not only are not addressed at least not only two topics.

00:53.850 --> 01:01.480
So now I'm going to create an application OK and an application.

01:01.620 --> 01:06.260
We use the common restaurant meals on a roast note.

01:06.570 --> 01:12.930
So then have to specify the name of the package because every good will must be contained inside the

01:12.930 --> 01:14.020
package.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.960
So our pack is now going to tell the sea.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.420
So that tells you this is a simulation of a turtle or what not out of the robot smarter than that we

01:27.420 --> 01:28.450
can run.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.690
And then I would like to you the application so I can place two times that the donkey.

01:35.790 --> 01:45.140
And then we find all the available applications that they can case will have those where mimic the DVR.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.630
I'm going first to start with that and see note turtled.

01:51.690 --> 01:54.870
So you know OK.

01:55.010 --> 01:55.630
Yes.

01:55.940 --> 02:02.670
And then when you see him not face it's small I'm glad he can do that and face with a small turtle here.

02:04.130 --> 02:10.220
OK so now first of all let's jack Oswald.

02:12.590 --> 02:12.930
K.

02:12.930 --> 02:18.230
So we had only crossed out in the beginning and then when we opened the new Not in front of it we have

02:18.230 --> 02:20.030
to put the same note.

02:20.770 --> 02:22.860
OK so we have to see.

02:23.390 --> 02:27.330
You know I have often gone to the scene.

02:27.550 --> 02:37.220
I can also see a list of topics I can make a list or pick these and you can see that I have three additional

02:37.220 --> 02:47.650
topic 31 C and the this is the name of the big color sensor and those have the additional topics when

02:47.660 --> 02:52.890
they come they come from these you know that they have lost.

02:53.430 --> 02:54.320
OK this is.

02:56.360 --> 03:05.780
So we got more information about a particular note or an hour or so topic.

03:06.890 --> 03:09.660
So we can have no effect.

03:09.740 --> 03:11.810
I would like to know more about the turtle.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.490
SEE YOU.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.060
OK so here I have all the information above and see no

03:23.640 --> 03:28.850
zeros not info.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.020
This is a no.

03:30.080 --> 03:39.380
Is see he publishes one topic with Easterton Juan-Carlos answer which you can find in the list of topics.

03:40.290 --> 03:41.370
That's right.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.820
One other topic that you see in the U.S. is called my city.

03:47.890 --> 03:50.460
It means the command button.

03:51.130 --> 03:57.080
So it's just comment and we will see how we can dodge and we can publish speed combat music.

03:57.090 --> 04:01.440
Another note that we opened just a few minutes later.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.380
OK these are all this emphasis.

04:04.380 --> 04:08.170
So there are no topics that Towson University.

04:08.220 --> 04:11.240
I'm going to discuss and his future tutorials.

04:12.940 --> 04:13.680
OK.

04:13.900 --> 04:24.310
And some more information about all of this of information related to that scene note.

04:24.470 --> 04:26.810
We will go ahead.

04:26.890 --> 04:27.300
No.

04:27.350 --> 04:33.440
You will see it and they can have all the information about the No.

04:33.490 --> 04:39.850
This is the published topic so it publishes consensus and publishes oppose both.

04:39.940 --> 04:47.190
This is the position the position of the doctor is X Y and data.

04:47.390 --> 04:48.240
Same thing here.

04:48.260 --> 04:58.870
We can also look into the information off topic so I can make cross topic peaceful and good about the

04:58.890 --> 05:00.030
columbianus.

05:00.510 --> 05:01.080
OK.

05:01.170 --> 05:05.680
So Kurt.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.340
OK.

05:09.780 --> 05:15.620
So this says that the type of the message is geometry and as slushes.

05:16.090 --> 05:25.020
So this message is the message that is responsible for moving different robots and we will see what

05:25.170 --> 05:27.060
what is the content of the message.

05:27.090 --> 05:32.790
It contains basically more information than the original seeking and

05:35.980 --> 05:44.450
it's all this is the content of the message and this topic has only one subscriber that you start to

05:44.470 --> 05:50.530
see and this is exactly what you mean by Krasnow information.

05:50.620 --> 05:58.510
So Gosset interactive seeing how it is subscribed to and you find people that will see that this is

05:58.850 --> 06:01.500
the subscribed note or subscriber.

06:02.880 --> 06:07.580
OK so if I want to see the content of this message right.

06:08.150 --> 06:12.910
So there is also a common that is called Ross and s g.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.550
Okay.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.280
And Z for Russ messages.

06:17.370 --> 06:23.590
And they call me show them the message that they would like to show.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.050
So I hear you.

06:26.270 --> 06:34.580
And as we say well this is the content of human the magistrates.

06:36.900 --> 06:45.000
Its it contains information permission as I said there is video of I see you x y z according to excoriate

06:45.580 --> 06:52.480
y coordinate and Z correctly and the angular velocity according to exploding what gardenin and decoding

06:52.630 --> 07:02.170
of course farther into the motion of space like this one we only use x y for me a little city and Z

07:02.380 --> 07:06.130
for angular velocity because we have the z axis on the top.

07:06.160 --> 07:06.560
OK.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.730
Coming outside from the start.

07:09.070 --> 07:13.930
And once the orientation of the.

07:14.290 --> 07:23.450
OK so this is all we can see the content of a message and show me the images.

07:24.630 --> 07:31.860
So we come back to us because these are the least of the things they can do the same for the post office

07:33.030 --> 07:36.030
topic before slush.

07:36.570 --> 07:42.900
And those Ok so I can see that type here is a total impose.

07:43.280 --> 07:47.160
This is the type of the message gave me because

07:50.610 --> 07:58.100
as you know in Russia you have several nodes and these notes they communicate with each other and when

07:58.100 --> 08:00.790
they communicate they must exchange messages.

08:00.940 --> 08:05.540
So for example one node would like to subscribe to Lubos OK.

08:05.680 --> 08:12.850
So the balls would be sent a message of typed up to see both and you can see we have the publisher of

08:12.850 --> 08:16.770
the post that is there to see if this confirms what we have here.

08:17.170 --> 08:23.110
OK so publication does not talk to the publishers but at one post

08:28.190 --> 08:30.800
will get.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.530
So I split the scene but I can also see the content of the message.

08:35.960 --> 08:42.800
And as he show that as in

08:46.090 --> 08:46.590
was

08:49.390 --> 09:02.040
OK so good as you both as you can guess is you find that important parameters excluding what you need

09:02.150 --> 09:06.120
and that is the orientation because we are in two dimensional space.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.740
We have X we have y.

09:08.880 --> 09:15.620
And the only addition of that over and here you have the linear city on the angular velocity that is

09:15.620 --> 09:18.930
calculated a certain of.

09:19.190 --> 09:24.620
So these are the contents of the message or the Pope's.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.950
OK so now I would like to start the.

09:28.170 --> 09:36.280
So we actually do publish need to publish calendars.

09:36.380 --> 09:50.420
The message get published is going to get the message I'm following so I gave it up and you often you

09:50.520 --> 09:50.860
know

09:54.110 --> 10:00.620
so I'm going to kind of you know it's it's not just it's turtle.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.710
So these are Denisof available notes.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.550
So we have lost turtles you know.

10:05.630 --> 10:08.810
Now we are going to start to see Yochi.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.650
So it means we can do daily operations using Akiba.

10:13.100 --> 10:21.210
It's funny a note really comes through us that allows you to send your comments to one.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.690
So I'm going to start this note.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.180
So this is our year.

10:40.620 --> 10:56.170
Now if I may give us the big news we don't have any new topic of me because it's not just a slogan.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.500
Ms.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.380
We have hope.

11:01.660 --> 11:11.080
So why that is not topic because of Title it is it actually uses the same tactile one common velocity.

11:11.690 --> 11:21.630
So now if for example I make cross topic infl C and even BEGIN to do one

11:24.260 --> 11:33.580
sitting on the moon because you know not only a subscriber but you have also a publisher.

11:33.900 --> 11:37.060
So the publisher is this not the one that they have already lost.

11:38.340 --> 11:47.080
Game and is going to go until they only Erse Noland you that divvy up

11:51.400 --> 11:51.660
your

12:00.550 --> 12:07.680
game so we can see that it publishes less.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.490
So not to move.

12:10.150 --> 12:17.260
So this obligation is waiting for all those to be placed on the keyboard so that Lyttleton moves so

12:17.530 --> 12:21.920
well at least here not in the book.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.500
So a velocity comment would be said.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.750
Now I'm really depressed.

12:27.550 --> 12:33.760
Passing so you can see while I am pressing the robot is now moving.

12:35.190 --> 12:36.040
So what does this need

12:40.810 --> 12:43.430
if you want to observe what is happening.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.270
We can see the content of the message.

12:46.410 --> 12:53.910
You can see the values of the message we get using Roessler be able.

12:54.080 --> 13:04.750
So we love it cool enough to show everybody off particular message on a particular topic.

13:04.770 --> 13:14.310
So now you start to see them going to go for now.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.960
There is nothing.

13:16.200 --> 13:22.910
But now I'm pressing one key that is straightforward so we can see what it is.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.050
We have now.

13:24.250 --> 13:35.170
And just for worki that is only velocity in the x axis We'll get to an angular velocity equal to zero

13:36.450 --> 13:37.000
OK.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.070
So I'm going to move again for

13:43.720 --> 13:54.960
why when when when I press forward on university zero and that is a very natural ok because I didn't

13:54.960 --> 13:55.980
make any.

13:56.130 --> 14:00.520
Now I'm going to move backward and look what happens if I move back.

14:00.510 --> 14:04.170
Were there any lessons it becomes negative.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.840
And this is resuming.

14:06.210 --> 14:06.980
OK.

14:07.230 --> 14:09.460
Look this is backwards again.

14:09.930 --> 14:10.490
OK.

14:11.520 --> 14:17.320
Steady angular velocity is zero because there is no.

14:17.410 --> 14:24.950
Now I'm going to turn and you can accept OK I'm taking place.

14:25.010 --> 14:29.920
So there is no linear velocity because there is no forward move.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.460
And Anderson here is my mistake.

14:34.760 --> 14:42.200
OK so if I did the right and would be too if I don't need to know I will get to the left.

14:42.200 --> 14:49.100
And you can see it becomes the because if you make an addition in the right direction it's going to

14:49.100 --> 15:00.420
be negative and even at that actions positive this is going to mean three groups of angle since OK you

15:00.430 --> 15:02.720
can see that is never here.

15:04.250 --> 15:11.570
There is no change in the White continent because the movement is actually occurring all in the x axis

15:12.540 --> 15:22.520
for the exercise and it all the z axis OK for any rotation on the z axis.

15:23.380 --> 15:29.300
OK so let me have a controversy to stop it going.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.530
The current velocity.

15:30.550 --> 15:34.110
I can now make an equal on both of the

15:38.510 --> 15:40.320
gate I made

15:49.030 --> 15:49.840
it.

15:49.930 --> 15:58.750
So now we make a nickel on the balls of the rubber so we can see this is the current composite of the

16:00.450 --> 16:01.220
OK.

16:01.570 --> 16:12.500
Now I'm going to move over to the dark corner.

16:12.980 --> 16:16.010
So you can see no cause of this.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.780
This is x axis.

16:17.780 --> 16:20.010
This is y axis.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.960
OK so x not zero.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.640
And why is that.

16:25.240 --> 16:25.670
OK.

16:25.750 --> 16:26.660
Let me go to the

16:32.490 --> 16:34.070
go and see what is now go easy

16:37.000 --> 16:41.110
and it becomes almost zero when I can't when it comes to that.

16:41.110 --> 16:43.280
So this fight is zero.

16:43.630 --> 16:48.550
So at this point the zero done is then zero and here is zero.

16:48.790 --> 16:55.810
So this is the dream that these x y coordinate OK.

16:55.830 --> 17:02.520
So if you want to make it under Disney you've got the

17:05.710 --> 17:06.610
OK.

17:07.070 --> 17:09.440
We'll go to samba.

17:12.170 --> 17:20.990
And we can show the position of Robert why it is more.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.090
And here we have ex-colonies work on it.

17:24.330 --> 17:31.260
And you can see what the robot is not movie Zero and angular velocity is you so observe linear and angular

17:31.260 --> 17:33.910
velocity is why I love this movie.

17:34.010 --> 17:41.260
Chris G.G. got that in Mao or something.

17:41.430 --> 17:47.020
The list becomes zero.

17:47.190 --> 17:48.380
So now it's up.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.930
It could be the both

17:55.340 --> 17:55.720
OK.

17:55.750 --> 18:03.750
So another way to move the robot also is to publish the values of the topic from the template.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.140
So look at this on.

18:06.150 --> 18:09.040
So here we use be pop.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.210
But for publishing.

18:11.910 --> 18:12.470
OK.

18:12.510 --> 18:22.260
And then the name of the topic and then the type of the topic you have humidity and it's just that's

18:22.310 --> 18:24.350
was never the use.

18:24.590 --> 18:32.300
So look at the values I'm going to publish the ability to point to the that velocity is one point eight

18:33.380 --> 18:37.900
you so you can see the other albums.

18:38.460 --> 18:45.840
Why it is not 18 because it was linear and it seems like now for example if I put the zero point zero

18:46.590 --> 18:50.160
for angular velocity it's going to move forward.

18:50.640 --> 18:51.430
OK.

18:51.690 --> 18:55.110
If I put this to some values you.

18:55.220 --> 19:02.090
And you can that your velocity is going to stay in place by combining.

19:02.370 --> 19:09.340
So if you want to have more information about that axiom you can go to the beach.

19:09.570 --> 19:10.080
OK.

19:10.100 --> 19:21.070
In addition there are more details about the different topics of this note and also you can look at

19:21.160 --> 19:26.490
understanding topics you know we debate as well understanding topics.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.870
So there is a complete tutorial on this.

19:30.170 --> 19:36.370
So the last thing I would like to show is this comment from digraph digraph

19:47.700 --> 19:48.230
here.

19:48.290 --> 19:53.650
It shows all of the different notes.

19:53.860 --> 19:59.710
So you chose that you have to know what I he know.

20:00.030 --> 20:04.340
And this one is probably a message that the OP is publishing.

20:04.340 --> 20:10.350
Mr. Curtis courtesy and this is a topic it's obviously topic to tendency and this topic is that in one

20:11.070 --> 20:19.100
the OK we can expand to see all the notes and topics.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.570
OK so these days.

20:20.880 --> 20:36.550
Is there one moment you of the one so you can see the notes that are available in the US system it's
