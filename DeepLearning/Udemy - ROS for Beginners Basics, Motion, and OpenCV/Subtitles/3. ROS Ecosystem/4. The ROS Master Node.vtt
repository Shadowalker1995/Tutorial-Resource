00:00.320 --> 00:03.700
So that was one in a billion.

00:03.770 --> 00:09.660
So I guess my point is smaller when you told him I'm going to present basic operation.

00:09.720 --> 00:13.660
So first of all I assume that you have already installed Rowse in your system.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.750
Now the first thing we need to do is to stop terrorists.

00:16.800 --> 00:22.500
We need the master know of the reservoir master.

00:23.250 --> 00:29.820
So if you want to start close the first thing that you need to you must and must note or what we call

00:29.820 --> 00:31.970
the Roscoff gate.

00:32.120 --> 00:38.270
So what is the main node in the US that will ensure the communication between any other node in the

00:38.270 --> 00:39.650
Robert operating system.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.960
So now the node is already on.

00:42.090 --> 00:48.990
So we can see here it gives it the link for the rescore that we call the postmaster you or I.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.260
So this is the rest mustardy or I we needed.

00:51.570 --> 01:00.540
Ok so now in order to see what is the effect of this what does the different nodes that we do want to

01:00.540 --> 01:02.340
see it go.

01:02.370 --> 01:05.810
Yes we can run node list.

01:06.380 --> 01:06.800
OK.

01:06.810 --> 01:09.240
So for the moment you have only one or at is point.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.520
First of all you are not that is called out.

01:13.340 --> 01:13.890
OK.

01:13.960 --> 01:20.460
There is one other note and this is because you have already started our crosscourt server so its waiting

01:20.550 --> 01:28.010
for other notes for publishing or subscribing topics so we can also check if we have subtopics this

01:29.310 --> 01:31.910
topic list to find the list of topics.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.920
For now we have two topics of interest.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.640
So these are the two different topics and ecosystem.

01:39.660 --> 01:47.600
So if he if we close I may Control-C underscore if we Clozaril score then if I try to find the road

01:47.600 --> 01:50.220
not least unable to communicate with the master.

01:50.430 --> 01:50.990
Why.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.920
Because it is no longer working.

01:52.950 --> 01:58.250
There is no central node is actually ensuring communication between the different ones.

01:58.440 --> 02:04.760
So there is no new words only there are no topics if I want to come back I have to restart again.

02:05.190 --> 02:11.230
Roscoff OK now I have to rush up close and personal.

02:11.230 --> 02:15.630
MS They both give the same as this.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.710
OK so now what the source code is activated.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.340
I can actually minimize the window.

02:21.390 --> 02:21.740
OK.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.750
Now we're going to start our first application.
