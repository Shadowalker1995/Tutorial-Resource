00:00.240 --> 00:03.500
So let's look at some commercially available laser scanners.

00:03.510 --> 00:10.200
There are several devices available in the market and I'm going to provide an overview of the most important

00:10.290 --> 00:16.050
ones that are used in Russia made with robots for example one popular and famous laser scanner is the

00:16.050 --> 00:16.780
hook for you.

00:16.890 --> 00:19.690
You are ready for an X easier to walk.

00:19.890 --> 00:25.830
So this one is characterized by a maximum range between 0 1 and five point six meters.

00:25.830 --> 00:32.480
So this is the maximum distance it can observe is five meters or around five meters and it has a nice

00:32.490 --> 00:33.390
dream of you.

00:33.390 --> 00:37.440
It can look at opening of two hundred forty degrees.

00:37.470 --> 00:42.010
So this means an angle between minus 20 degrees and 120 degrees.

00:42.060 --> 00:47.520
And basically this is useful in indoor applications because five meters or four meters is not sufficient

00:47.520 --> 00:52.840
to be operational in an outdoor environment so you can see this kind of frequency still hurts.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.410
It means is going to spend 100 millisecond Pesca.

00:56.430 --> 01:00.360
So in one second he's going to scan ten times the range.

01:00.390 --> 01:06.120
So this is not very high frequency for that and it operates on a low voltage and rates low current.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.150
It's only 5 volts because the interface is used.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.770
So you can plug it on any of us we do work.

01:11.850 --> 01:17.560
And five words will be sufficient to power the laser scanner and it's going to generate only one in

01:17.560 --> 01:18.780
five days.

01:18.810 --> 01:24.570
So the price is around is a little bit more than 1000 U.S. dollars.

01:24.570 --> 01:29.520
On the bright side you can see another also of popular laser scanner which is currently used in total

01:29.520 --> 01:30.870
about three robots.

01:30.870 --> 01:35.490
Get to the airport at eight two and there is also the new version A3.

01:35.690 --> 01:38.580
OK this one that has a maximum range of six meters.

01:38.580 --> 01:45.450
It has a little bit longer than you or easier for and it has a maximum field of view of 360 degrees

01:45.450 --> 01:51.720
so you can observe all around its impact or it has an angle between minus 80 and 180 so you can see

01:51.770 --> 01:54.950
the field of view here is bigger because you see this laser scanner.

01:54.970 --> 01:57.600
It's actually we keep rotating this one doesn't rotate.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.190
It has just a static field of view and this is going to rotate.

02:01.230 --> 02:04.850
And for that reason it's able to view around 360 degrees.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.880
It's used in indoor environment because of the short range.

02:07.890 --> 02:15.990
It can also then Hertz and it operates at the same voltage 5.0 and zero point forty five compact.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.690
It doesn't have a user interface but it has you arc interface which can be connected to a serial port

02:21.690 --> 02:22.290
on a computer.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.390
And the cost is much less expensive than the hooker.

02:25.450 --> 02:29.160
It's only around 470 U.S. dollars.

02:29.160 --> 02:35.300
These are more sophisticated and advanced laser scanners which are typically used in other environments

02:35.310 --> 02:41.430
so we can have the six elements 151 which has a maximum range of 20 meters and the maximum few of you

02:41.490 --> 02:46.510
of 270 degrees and basically it is used in Hauger invites.

02:46.530 --> 02:49.190
So you can see here in this country Kwasi is even higher.

02:49.200 --> 02:55.890
It can sample scans at 25 Hertz up to 50 hertz and for this it will require a higher voltage.

02:55.890 --> 03:00.580
So around ten point eight God it has different interfaces not us.

03:00.640 --> 03:06.420
It has its own interface interface and can just interface and express his you can see it's much more

03:06.420 --> 03:07.050
expansive.

03:07.050 --> 03:12.540
It's more than 5200 U.S. dollars so basically laser scanners with good performance.

03:12.550 --> 03:14.380
They are very very expensive.

03:14.490 --> 03:20.190
On the right side you have the you hook up your day in 30 and X and it has a maximum range of 30 meters

03:20.280 --> 03:24.580
which is very long and a maximum in the view of 270.

03:24.630 --> 03:30.690
It's used in outdoor environments but it can sample at 40 hertz which means 25 millisecond per Scott.

03:30.690 --> 03:35.240
It operates on a voltage of 12 volt and generates 1 7 on deck.

03:35.250 --> 03:44.580
It has asked me to interface and the price is more than 4700 U.S. dollars in addition to laser rangefinders.

03:44.600 --> 03:52.870
Actually the cameras also are equipped with laser scanners and the cameras are known to be depth camera.

03:52.980 --> 03:58.740
So why not call them depth camera because they have a stereo camera here which are going to provide

03:58.860 --> 04:04.780
a two dimensional image and then the laser scanner is going to provide information about the depth.

04:04.860 --> 04:11.640
So these cameras are able to generate depth images which are three dimensional but you can see on the

04:11.640 --> 04:15.360
left side even for Astra as or for Intel results.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.820
This one is actually the laser scanner.

04:17.820 --> 04:23.250
So the characteristic of the laser scanner of these are going to be camera Astra as can look up to eight

04:23.250 --> 04:30.000
metres and it has a maximum field of view of 60 degrees or is under 50 degrees vertical and 70 degrees

04:30.000 --> 04:30.840
in diagonal.

04:30.840 --> 04:37.530
It is basically used in indoor applications and the depth image size is 640 multiplied by four hundred

04:37.680 --> 04:38.590
eighty.

04:38.620 --> 04:48.300
A 16 bit 13 frame per second it operates on five vote and it has to use be 2 1 0 in case the cost is

04:48.300 --> 04:54.990
around 170 U.S. dollar on the right side we have in the real sense camera of 200 which has a maximum

04:54.990 --> 04:56.780
range of three point five meters.

04:56.790 --> 05:03.740
It has almost the same maximum of you 60 degrees in hoodies up to 50 degrees in vertical and 70 degrees

05:03.760 --> 05:10.310
in diagonal it's used in indoor environments it has scant frequency of what you heard operate on fibroid

05:10.690 --> 05:13.410
and has an interface USP 3.0.

05:13.460 --> 05:18.120
The price is similar to the Astra as another type of laser scanners.

05:18.170 --> 05:21.760
Is the leader lead and this one is the legal version 3.

05:21.770 --> 05:27.150
And basically this one is actually doesn't make several measurements it makes only one measurement test

05:27.560 --> 05:29.760
which is in a different direction.

05:30.040 --> 05:36.050
OK so it has only one laser beam and it's a compact optical distance measurements and so this one is

05:36.110 --> 05:39.520
used in several applications especially for example in droves.

05:39.770 --> 05:45.770
They are put on the bottom of the frame so you can estimate the attitude of the drone or the distance

05:45.770 --> 05:46.490
to get out.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.560
It's going to look to the ground and then it can be used to estimate the distance.

05:50.570 --> 05:56.120
So as a mentioned it only returns one measurement values that is in the front direction and you can

05:56.120 --> 06:00.080
see here it can reach very high rates up to 40 meters.

06:00.080 --> 06:05.290
So it operates on 5:01 DC and it can be used in both indoor and outdoor environments.

06:05.300 --> 06:12.470
The optical aperture is twelve point five millimeters and it has two interfaces either out to C or BW.

06:12.500 --> 06:17.720
And it can generate that very high frequency up to 500 readings there.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.530
And the price is around 130 U.S. dollars.

06:20.570 --> 06:27.320
So this was an overview about the laser scanners and their main characteristics and I have also presented

06:27.380 --> 06:32.840
an overview of the commercially available laser scanner devices infinite's videos.

06:32.960 --> 06:39.440
I'm going to show some concrete examples of laser scanners how to connect them with rocks and how to

06:39.440 --> 06:46.460
extract the information like for example the list of ranges the maximum angle minimum angle the maximum

06:46.460 --> 06:49.300
distance and all the information and so on.

06:49.310 --> 06:55.370
And as I mentioned before understanding how it works is really important and crucial to understand later

06:55.370 --> 06:58.840
on how to navigate and how to avoid the obstacles.
