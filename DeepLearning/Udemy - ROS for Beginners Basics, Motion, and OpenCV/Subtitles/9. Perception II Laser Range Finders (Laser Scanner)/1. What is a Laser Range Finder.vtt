Larmer Hamilton said I want to be getting hammered and excuse me.

00:03.780 --> 00:09.480
Hi guys and welcome back to new tutorial in the course robot operating system basics motion and open

00:09.480 --> 00:10.210
city.

00:10.230 --> 00:16.670
So so far we have covered a lot of different concepts including those basics like the Russified system.

00:16.670 --> 00:20.560
Those topics are snowdrops messages are services and different things.

00:20.610 --> 00:23.970
Then we have talked about motion and how to make a robot move.

00:23.970 --> 00:29.610
What are the different topics that are responsible for making a move and other topics that are responsible

00:29.610 --> 00:31.850
for finding the location of the robot.

00:31.890 --> 00:37.650
Of course we have applied this on some simulator and in future lectures you're going to talk about more

00:37.650 --> 00:45.220
realistic robots and then in the third part we have talked about up and see which is about robotic perception.

00:45.360 --> 00:51.120
So today I'm going to talk about a new tutorial how laser scanners or laser rangefinders work and this

00:51.120 --> 00:54.000
is actually another way of robotic perception.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.450
So the robot can actually see the work using a camera.

00:57.480 --> 01:03.060
And for these we use tools like oppositely in order to process the images and video streams coming from

01:03.060 --> 01:06.210
the camera and extract useful information from that.

01:06.210 --> 01:12.360
But the problem the camera up on provide us today matching that information on the picture and a picture

01:12.390 --> 01:18.860
doesn't say anything about for example the distance of obstacles or the distance of objects from that

01:18.870 --> 01:25.140
orbit and for this we need a third dimension which is actually obtained using a specific device like

01:25.230 --> 01:28.440
rangefinders or we call them also a laser scanner.

01:28.650 --> 01:34.770
And these devices are able to find the distance to objects and they are taking much useful in several

01:34.830 --> 01:36.020
types of applications.

01:36.030 --> 01:39.110
So let's see how these laser scanners work.

01:39.270 --> 01:40.730
So what is a laser scanner.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.310
Basically it is a device that can measure the distance to obstacles.

01:44.390 --> 01:50.550
And there are several devices not only based on laser they are also intra sonic sensors which are based

01:50.550 --> 01:56.550
on sound not to determine the distance to obstacles but laser scanners or laser rings find those are

01:56.550 --> 01:59.820
based on a laser to detect the distance the obstacles.

01:59.820 --> 02:00.780
So how do they work.

02:00.780 --> 02:07.300
Actually a device like the following is going to send a laser beam in different directions and then

02:07.300 --> 02:11.200
displays that are going to bounce back when they hit an obstacle.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.690
And there are going to be captured by a camera.

02:13.860 --> 02:20.610
So knowing the offset between the laser source and the camera it is possible to estimate using that

02:20.610 --> 02:24.550
type of flight because the laser travels at the speed of light.

02:24.570 --> 02:31.080
It's possible to estimate using type of light the distance to the objects and these devices are actually

02:31.080 --> 02:34.850
very useful in several robotics applications for example.

02:34.890 --> 02:40.680
They are used in some application for building a map and some it means simultaneous localization and

02:40.680 --> 02:41.520
mapping.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.170
They are also used for obstacle avoidance without lasers.

02:45.240 --> 02:51.060
The robot cannot know the distance to obstacles and in this case it can easily be an obstacle that comes

02:51.150 --> 02:52.020
in his path.

02:52.230 --> 02:57.750
So for example when we worked with the turtle sea we just used kind of bland that we didn't consider

02:57.750 --> 02:58.470
any obstacle.

02:58.530 --> 03:02.060
This is not realistic orbit when it operate in an environment.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.230
It will have to manage how to avoid obstacles in his path.

03:05.250 --> 03:09.810
And for this we need rangefinders like laser scanners or ultrasonic sensors.

03:09.810 --> 03:17.190
And for this reason laser scans are crucial and important and necessary for any navigation mission of

03:17.190 --> 03:17.610
the job.

03:17.610 --> 03:23.700
So that's why the objective of this section is to understand how the laser scanner works how we can

03:23.790 --> 03:29.400
connect a laser scanner to Russ how we can read the information come coming from the laser scanner.

03:29.490 --> 03:33.380
What are the medical information or the meta data of the laser scanner.

03:33.420 --> 03:36.690
All of these are going to be described in these coming lectures.
