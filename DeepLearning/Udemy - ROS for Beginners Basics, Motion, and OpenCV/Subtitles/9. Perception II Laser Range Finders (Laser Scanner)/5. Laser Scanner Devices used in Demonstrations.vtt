00:00.200 --> 00:04.360
Have These are the two devices we are going to show up and they come to us.

00:04.530 --> 00:09.570
So let's say we have an atheist life up which has a range of four meters.

00:09.600 --> 00:17.150
And as you can see I'd say it has to come and the left side has a laser scanner.

00:17.340 --> 00:21.560
So this is able to generate images.

00:21.570 --> 00:27.200
And also it's possible to convert the image into a laser scanner.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.320
So you know how to do that.

00:29.340 --> 00:37.500
EROS Let's have a device which also has a range of four meters and the difference between the two devices

00:37.590 --> 00:46.080
is that it has a sheet of only 60 degrees which is a little bit narrow as compared to the laser scanner

00:46.080 --> 00:49.260
which has a view of 240 degrees.

00:49.620 --> 00:57.120
So of course the performance of the hoax is better in terms of the feel of you loves the obstacles at

00:57.240 --> 00:58.310
a wider range.

00:58.420 --> 01:04.130
But both of them operate at the same maximum distance which is around 4 meters.

01:04.120 --> 01:10.030
Let's see how to connect them to interact with these two devices and how we are able to observe the

01:10.030 --> 01:12.680
changes collected by these two devices.
