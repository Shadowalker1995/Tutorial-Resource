00:00.190 --> 00:06.040
This video I'm going to show how to see the laser scan information into Rosebank file and how to play

00:06.090 --> 00:06.370
it.

00:06.380 --> 00:10.310
Of course this operation is useful because not everybody has a laser scanner.

00:10.350 --> 00:13.740
And later on there will be some and exercises to do.

00:13.770 --> 00:18.350
Probably not all of you would have a laser scanner to get the messages from really bites.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.430
So I'm going now to record all the messages coming from this country.

00:22.470 --> 00:28.350
And later on we can play them again so that the messages will be coming as they are really coming from

00:28.650 --> 00:29.830
the real device.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.560
Let's see how can we do that.

00:31.560 --> 00:37.080
First of all I need to start Lescaut and then we need to start the driver of the laser scanner.

00:37.140 --> 00:39.980
In this case I'm going to show you these range finder

00:46.080 --> 00:52.050
and then I would create a static transformer publisher as you already know so in order to define the

00:52.050 --> 00:55.060
location of the laser with respect to what frame.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.570
As already explained before.

00:56.650 --> 01:01.300
And then we need to create a new folder where to put the log information.

01:01.350 --> 01:07.530
I'm going to call these front back files OK and then we go to the butterflies of course initially it

01:07.530 --> 01:10.490
is empty before starting the logging of the messages.

01:10.500 --> 01:15.590
Let me Arbys first run armies and navies as usual.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.850
The information about the laser scanner.

01:18.030 --> 01:25.980
So here we need to select the scan to pick the laser scanner visualization we can increase the font.

01:26.160 --> 01:33.140
So it is more visible and they can also show the frame of the laser itself which is this one.

01:33.330 --> 01:42.530
Ok now I'm ready to start recording what they can do is not to use the rest but require Dash 8.

01:42.590 --> 01:48.290
So Leslie is going to record everything they can specify whether they want to record one topic or two

01:48.290 --> 01:50.470
topics but I'm going to record everything.

01:51.670 --> 01:58.860
Not as you can see it starts to put into a log file all the messages coming from these different topics.

01:58.860 --> 02:04.060
So in the meanwhile you can see now this is the laser scanner.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.670
Everything is being recorded.

02:05.910 --> 02:11.880
I'm going to move in front of the laser and you'll see me moving right in front of the lens.

02:12.030 --> 02:18.300
So later when we are going to play back again you'll see that the same motion is going to be replayed

02:18.390 --> 02:19.160
in the same way.

02:19.290 --> 02:25.810
So I'm going to start pulling now of service OK sir.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.310
This is a form that is not the case of movie.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.230
He is just capturing this

02:40.700 --> 02:45.590
so it's all white and then later on.

02:45.710 --> 02:49.710
Well I think it's going to be played exactly the same.

03:00.020 --> 03:02.920
Now and into those warm

03:06.420 --> 03:07.180
OK.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.490
So I have everything that

03:12.340 --> 03:13.900
I'm going to close everything now

03:19.160 --> 03:22.280
goes armies so we can stop recording

03:25.240 --> 03:26.650
I would stop everything now.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.470
Even the driver and us know.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.280
OK so let me go to again.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.300
And way to run articles.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.600
I will add the laser scanner.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.630
I mean those are the axes of course.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.250
There is nothing to show now because nothing is playing.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.280
There is not even a topic here.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.320
Now the idea is actually to play again.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.880
So looking at the point of the backfires you can find now a new log file that is called.

03:53.940 --> 03:59.010
This is the date of the get back so we can play this fight again.

03:59.280 --> 04:06.190
We can look at the formation of the butterfly using respect for this or the formation.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.410
This is the path.

04:07.680 --> 04:14.190
This is the version the duration the start the undie the signs and make up by the number of messages

04:14.770 --> 04:18.890
and the different topics that were monitored and recorded.

04:19.020 --> 04:26.360
So now if you want to play the bat file we can use the rest but they then the Badfinger.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.530
So now it is playing

04:31.380 --> 04:41.230
now I can play the message and you will observe now that the same operation that was done we sort of

04:41.290 --> 04:43.100
are going to be replayed and repeat it.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.830
So we wait a little bit and we will see now the object moving around.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.460
OK so the motion has started.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.720
Now you can see here.

04:51.470 --> 04:53.210
This is the place where I was moving.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.410
So I was going to continue moving in the same way that it was required.

04:57.980 --> 04:58.620
OK.

05:00.040 --> 05:00.930
Now the objective.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.870
So we can actually use the same backside in order to work with this topic to process the information

05:07.870 --> 05:10.030
coming in and the ugly times.

05:10.150 --> 05:16.330
So this is a useful method if you want to split a particular events into a bug fight and then you can

05:16.330 --> 05:22.840
play them and the Balata algorithm and test your algorithms with respect to the event that are stored

05:22.930 --> 05:23.710
in the log file.

05:23.740 --> 05:32.510
So this is when I come close to the sensor then going backward then we start recording of it.

05:33.980 --> 05:40.220
So the bagpipe is going to continue to play until it stops up dramatically and you can see everything

05:40.220 --> 05:41.760
was stopped.

05:41.840 --> 05:48.600
The and this is the way how we can actually store the information about not only this country but any

05:48.600 --> 05:54.460
kind of topic it can be recorded using those but then play game in the next video.

05:54.480 --> 06:01.390
I'm going to show how to write a note that subscribes to the skun topic whatever it comes from but it

06:01.410 --> 06:03.140
comes from a real laser.

06:03.150 --> 06:07.740
And then I will show you how to process this information both in Bison and C++.
