00:00.760 --> 00:04.320
Not come with me.

00:04.500 --> 00:09.150
Hello guys and welcome back to new tutorial on laser rangefinders withdraws.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.610
In this video I'm going to demonstrate how to connect.

00:12.620 --> 00:17.110
How cool you are you are 0 for the x rays finder with reskin at.

00:17.150 --> 00:21.930
And this particular razor is very popular and is used in many robotic platforms.

00:22.020 --> 00:28.290
As already explained in the introductory lecture this laser sensor has seen a range of around 4 meters

00:28.380 --> 00:33.880
and a few of you of 200 40 degrees with an approximate cost of 1000 dollars.

00:33.890 --> 00:39.720
There are a number of steps that we need to follow in order to connect the sensor and make it up and

00:39.720 --> 00:40.360
running with it.

00:40.360 --> 00:46.500
So first of all we need to make sure that the you know package is downloaded to our system and then

00:46.590 --> 00:50.590
we have to run it using the command Rajasthani you know the genome.

00:50.640 --> 00:56.940
So this is a genetic node that can be used in order to access and connect to many sensors including

00:57.700 --> 01:01.810
zero for an x that we are dealing with in this video.

01:02.010 --> 01:07.740
By running this node all the information coming from the laser range finder will be published in a topic

01:07.740 --> 01:11.780
called Sky and this topic as already mentioned several times.

01:11.820 --> 01:20.920
This is the common name of topic for laser scanners data and information so unlike the case of the camera

01:21.180 --> 01:26.940
we don't have good depth image that we need to convert a scanned topic but we will have direct access

01:26.940 --> 01:34.140
to the topic as soon as we execute the node you know which is going to start the drivers of the laser

01:34.140 --> 01:34.630
scanner.

01:34.650 --> 01:40.980
However there is one thing that we need to define which is very important and that is the transformation

01:40.980 --> 01:43.220
between the map frame and the laser free.

01:43.260 --> 01:47.380
Of course we will have a complete chapter on the transformation Indras.

01:47.610 --> 01:53.110
So don't worry about that if you don't understand what our transformation is and what you see.

01:53.210 --> 01:59.640
But to explain it in a very simple way we're going just to tell us what is the location of this sensor

01:59.730 --> 02:01.080
into the environment.

02:01.080 --> 02:07.530
OK so since we don't have any specific location we're going to say that this sensor is located at point

02:07.950 --> 02:12.790
0 0 0 coordinate in x y and z coordinates.

02:12.810 --> 02:13.310
OK.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.140
And the orientation will be zero.

02:15.360 --> 02:22.680
So to do that we are going to use the package D F and the No that is called static transform publisher

02:22.770 --> 02:27.570
which is going to create a transformation between the map frame and the laser.

02:27.660 --> 02:28.750
As already mentioned.

02:28.770 --> 02:34.770
It is just specifying the position of the laser in the water and you are going to say that this position

02:34.800 --> 02:41.330
is going to be zeros or x y z coordinates and also 0 for the orientation or the end.

02:41.490 --> 02:46.470
As already mentioned we are going to talk about this into more details for now it doesn't matter if

02:46.470 --> 02:52.890
we put any kind of number here because our objective is to visualize the sensory data and not to localize

02:52.950 --> 02:55.030
objects with respect to what.

02:55.290 --> 03:01.680
This is basically the simplest explanation so just assume that we can define the position of the laser

03:01.770 --> 03:09.960
with respect to the water as being at the location 0 0 0 and at the only station zero that's a and then

03:10.050 --> 03:15.750
after starting the static transform and you actually know you're going to visualize the formation of

03:15.750 --> 03:22.140
this country big both using just a big echo and also using Arbys which is the trust visualization.

03:22.170 --> 03:25.380
So let's see how it works in practice.

03:25.430 --> 03:29.060
Now we are ready to start working with the Hoquiam sensor.

03:29.240 --> 03:35.720
The first thing we need to do is to connect the sensor to be current.

03:36.620 --> 03:42.210
And then as you can see we need to connect to the since you're going to work on the Linux environment.

03:42.210 --> 03:48.320
Now we are ready to start the driver was powered on of course in order to run the driver we need to

03:48.310 --> 03:55.910
start Scott because we will use our son so first of what we need to start M.A. and that we need to make

03:55.910 --> 03:58.860
sure that you know you you start.

03:59.030 --> 04:09.350
So what we can do we can do is you know if we get it it's time for us you know did you or did he not

04:09.510 --> 04:11.000
get the password.

04:11.090 --> 04:13.120
So it's already installed on my computer.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.250
If it is not this cold.

04:14.320 --> 04:21.050
So you have to install it first and then you are ready to start the drive restaurant.

04:21.190 --> 04:30.920
You already know you are you know now it is connected to the serial device and start streaming the data.

04:31.130 --> 04:39.290
So let me first close the connection and before connecting let's make it stop exist.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.020
So as you can see we don't have any on topic for the moment.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.470
Now I'm going to start again.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.310
Do you already know

04:48.220 --> 04:50.120
not it is connected again.

04:50.160 --> 05:00.100
So I can now rest topic list as you can see now we have the second topic gay and different other topics

05:00.340 --> 05:04.720
but we are not interested to discuss topics that contains all the information as usual what you can

05:04.720 --> 05:05.390
do.

05:05.650 --> 05:10.470
You can use this topic echo scandal.

05:10.710 --> 05:14.260
And here we are getting the array of ranges.

05:14.310 --> 05:16.050
OK so this is the early ages.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.000
You can observe it.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.210
It is much longer than the Asias life pro are going to be coming up.

05:22.230 --> 05:26.380
So don't forget that here we have a field of view of 270 degrees.

05:26.430 --> 05:31.430
But as we age just like we have a field of view of only 60 degrees.

05:31.440 --> 05:38.230
And basically this is now the minimum angle and the maximum again in region if we convert this one in

05:38.240 --> 05:43.140
two degrees so you'll find around minus 135.

05:43.270 --> 05:45.910
We can use a calculator just to check it.

05:45.910 --> 05:50.490
So we have two certified 6:1.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.210
We were told by the 14 multiplied by one patient.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.630
So it's around yes 135.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.720
So it's between 145 and minus 135.

05:59.790 --> 06:03.710
So the field of your here is actually two hundred seventy.

06:03.810 --> 06:09.870
So now we are able to get all the information using or stopping a goal like we did in the previous video

06:09.990 --> 06:14.640
with the other day we come in and up we would like to visualize Melissa Scott and for this we are going

06:14.640 --> 06:17.360
to use the restaurant Arby's Arby's again.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.610
And remember that Arby's is the rest of the realization to

06:24.730 --> 06:29.520
here initially we don't have any topic because it's not in our list.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.350
So we can do it from here.

06:31.510 --> 06:36.560
And we use Laserscope then we can select the topic here.

06:36.810 --> 06:44.680
Scott as you can see we're still unable to see anything here because we have a warning says that there

06:44.680 --> 06:46.660
is no data.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.370
There is no transformation date.

06:48.370 --> 06:55.030
Now here we are if it's true the map is not defined and there is no frame associated with the laser

06:55.030 --> 06:57.240
range finder you would find.

06:57.370 --> 07:04.540
So the difference is that when we started open I to it already started with the signing frames for the

07:04.540 --> 07:05.330
camera.

07:05.650 --> 07:09.410
That's why we were able actually to visualize the laser scanner.

07:09.580 --> 07:16.000
But here with the hook or your sensor using this driver you know it doesn't actually start any brain

07:16.180 --> 07:19.470
doesn't about what is the position of sensor in the world.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.680
For this reason we need to find this man.

07:21.730 --> 07:22.750
How can he do that so.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.000
Look no there isn't.

07:24.180 --> 07:30.470
I'm going to use transformation has already explained in the introduction we would use a static transform

07:30.490 --> 07:36.300
publisher between the free map that represents the word environment.

07:36.520 --> 07:44.590
And that is a tree that represents the location of the laser was really explained just for you and he

07:44.830 --> 07:51.080
literally position is this is going to be zero on the x y and z coordinates and also for the patient

07:51.640 --> 07:58.300
of course he mumbled that talk about this study he said more than is when you talk about formations

07:59.440 --> 08:01.050
because this topic is a problem.

08:01.060 --> 08:10.590
But for now it's been just a matter of finding a certain location for the laser scanner and all of this

08:10.720 --> 08:12.820
the patient would be just the something.

08:13.050 --> 08:20.070
Now when I started the F formation OK I no longer have any problem here.

08:20.220 --> 08:26.350
So you can see now the map is defined and they have also the laser both of them well-define.

08:26.670 --> 08:34.600
Well first of all we can move this intersection here just looking the size of two point five and we

08:34.600 --> 08:37.020
can have some observations.

08:37.030 --> 08:44.470
So the first observation that we can do now is that the field of view of the laser scanner is much larger

08:44.740 --> 08:48.860
than the life boat camera that we discussed in the previous video.

08:49.090 --> 08:56.650
So you can see now we have complete coverage of almost And then around 270 degrees.

08:56.650 --> 09:02.310
Remember for the camera we only had this fortunate that was covered in present.

09:02.380 --> 09:07.720
Almost one fourth or one fifth of these total coverage by the laser scanner.

09:07.780 --> 09:14.380
We can also show the position of the laser scanner by here X and so here in the middle.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.540
So it's absurd.

09:15.580 --> 09:18.580
This is 150 degrees on the left and the right side.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.950
And also it can go even backward.

09:20.950 --> 09:24.250
OK so you can see I'm sitting here now.

09:24.370 --> 09:31.030
And you can see now the laser is actually in my motion as well because it's not even behind me with

09:31.030 --> 09:35.220
an optical front of a laser scanner as you can see now.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.060
OK.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.970
So now I'm looking this bar.

09:40.290 --> 09:45.650
We can see now this is the location of the bar in front of the laser scanner.

09:45.910 --> 09:51.690
So this shows actually the capabilities for using laser scanner to detect obstacles.

09:51.700 --> 09:55.280
A wider view of this is a major advantage.

09:55.340 --> 09:58.860
Compare with use that actually can become better.

09:58.990 --> 10:06.070
So this matters a lot especially if we use the laser scanner to build maps using some algorithms they

10:06.110 --> 10:12.540
need maps some with larger if you will result in a better accuracy on the maps.

10:12.580 --> 10:17.880
And this is why because of the laser scanner depends on the effect.

10:18.430 --> 10:24.450
Now we were able to visualize the laser scanner out of Houston also using at least the next step is

10:24.540 --> 10:31.140
all that information coming from the laser scanner system and using some application logic.

10:31.240 --> 10:37.900
So in the next video I'm going to show you what we know and what you subscribe to the laser scanner

10:38.160 --> 10:44.410
the political and statistics for example if you want to calculate the maximum distance of the maximum

10:44.410 --> 10:47.130
range the angle of the maximum range.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.790
What is the minimum distance.

10:48.850 --> 10:51.070
What is the distance to a certain angle.

10:51.070 --> 10:54.860
So all of these parameters can be calculated using gross.

10:54.880 --> 11:00.190
First of all you need to be a no subscriber the talking scan.

11:00.280 --> 11:05.670
And then in the callback function you can process information coming from the center.

11:05.740 --> 11:06.850
So let's see how that works.
