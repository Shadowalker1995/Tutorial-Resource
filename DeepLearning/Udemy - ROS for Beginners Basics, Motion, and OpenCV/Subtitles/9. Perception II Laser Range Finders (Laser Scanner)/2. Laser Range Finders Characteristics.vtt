00:00.300 --> 00:05.460
So if you have a robot and you want to do that up with the first thing you need to do is actually to

00:05.580 --> 00:08.110
get or to chase a laser scanner.

00:08.130 --> 00:13.080
But there are several available devices in the market and there are a lot of characteristics that we

00:13.080 --> 00:14.210
need to understand.

00:14.310 --> 00:20.640
And there are a lot of features that will help us making the correct decision about which laser range

00:20.640 --> 00:23.100
finder that is appropriate for our applications.

00:23.100 --> 00:28.800
So for emulous or scanner these are the main characteristics that you need to figure out before selecting

00:28.890 --> 00:29.720
or one application.

00:29.730 --> 00:33.750
First of all a laser scanner is characterized by a minimum angle and the maximum.

00:33.750 --> 00:40.470
And so this is how this would look like it will send a beam of laser over a certain angle.

00:40.470 --> 00:45.660
And here we have the minimum angle and the maximum and the total between the minimum angle and the maximum

00:45.700 --> 00:50.970
anger that represents the field of view and different places have different feet of use.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.900
And of course this will impact their cost their performance.

00:53.910 --> 01:00.660
And so as you can see in the picture the laser is going to send several laser beam from the minimum

01:00.750 --> 01:06.660
angle to the maximum angle and you can see here we have separate beams and there is an angle difference

01:06.660 --> 01:08.840
between one and another.

01:08.950 --> 01:09.490
OK.

01:09.540 --> 01:15.150
And the difference is it's got the angle increment and this represents the angular discussion of the

01:15.150 --> 01:16.030
laser range finder.

01:16.110 --> 01:22.060
OK also that is a scan that is characterized by the time increment which is the time between the measurements.

01:22.170 --> 01:26.610
We're going to stand by measurement and then another one and that then between two measurements is called

01:26.610 --> 01:31.290
the time increment and this time increment is different from another time that is called the scan time

01:31.380 --> 01:34.660
which is the time between two Scots and one scan.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.730
It means sending all the different beams.

01:37.860 --> 01:42.510
OK so this is one scan and then after getting all the measurements we sent another Scott.

01:42.630 --> 01:48.270
So we have the time increment and we have also the scan time that is the time between two different

01:48.270 --> 01:48.860
scans.

01:48.930 --> 01:52.580
And very important characteristic of the laser scanner is the range.

01:52.620 --> 01:55.660
And for this we have the minimum wage and the maximum wage.

01:55.740 --> 01:59.030
So the minimum range is to present the minimal observable range.

01:59.040 --> 02:04.890
And for example some sensors are not able to see objects that have a distance lower than for example

02:04.950 --> 02:12.060
a certain range for example some sensors cannot see objects that are in a distance lower than for example

02:12.300 --> 02:13.750
a meter or a meter.

02:13.860 --> 02:19.860
Now this is these are characteristics that may differ from one laser scanner to another and a more important

02:19.860 --> 02:21.930
characteristic is the maximum range.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.880
Some sensors are able to see for example only four meters away.

02:25.890 --> 02:30.470
Some other sensors that they can see 10 meters away or 20 meters away or 30 meters away.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.020
So the maximum range will depend from one laser scanner to another.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.970
For example if you work in an indoor environment in this case maybe four meters will be sufficient.

02:38.970 --> 02:44.400
However if you use four meters kind of an outdoor environment it will not make much sense because in

02:44.400 --> 02:47.640
outdoor environments spaces are larger and longer.

02:47.630 --> 02:50.200
So usually we use 20 meters or 30 meters.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.280
And of course this will have a major impact on the cost.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.880
The longer the range is the higher the cost will be.

02:55.890 --> 02:59.380
And of course the laser will return as the list of ranges.

02:59.490 --> 03:05.730
So you can see here every laser that is going to propagate in space is going to bounce back whenever

03:05.820 --> 03:08.670
it reaches an object and then it bounces back.

03:08.670 --> 03:12.570
The laser is able to estimate the distance to that object from this laser.

03:12.580 --> 03:18.540
OK so here whatever every laser coming back we're going to have energy that will contain the list of

03:18.570 --> 03:24.140
changes and then we can actually collect the list of ranges and then process them for example to be

03:24.240 --> 03:27.410
map or to avoid after or to perform navigation.

03:27.420 --> 03:28.070
And so.

03:28.210 --> 03:33.320
And finally we have also the list of intensities coming back from the laser scanner.

03:33.330 --> 03:39.230
So this is an interesting example for example of a laser scanner that will hit obstacles and then we

03:39.230 --> 03:42.820
will see that every laser beam is going to represent one ridge.

03:42.840 --> 03:49.230
So rest later on you will see that we can have an array of ranges and every race for example this is

03:49.290 --> 03:56.580
the minimum angle we one point two and then the angle just after that returned 1.3 and then 2.0 and

03:56.580 --> 04:02.480
so on depending on the value that bounces back from the laser scanner after it hits an obstacle.

04:02.620 --> 04:06.400
OK so the distribution of ranges may look something like this.

04:06.450 --> 04:09.200
We can collect it using cross using software.

04:09.240 --> 04:14.490
And then we can process this information in order for example to avoid obstacles or build them up.

04:14.490 --> 04:20.180
So something very important to notice is that the front direction is the angle zero.

04:20.220 --> 04:24.180
And then you can go the right side you have the minimum angle to the left side.

04:24.210 --> 04:29.760
You will have the maximum for example here you have a field of view of 90 degrees between zero and minus

04:29.760 --> 04:31.840
45 and zero plus 45.

04:31.860 --> 04:32.670
You can actually do.

04:32.670 --> 04:37.570
I'm going to present the most popular and common laser range finder available.

04:37.640 --> 04:37.900
