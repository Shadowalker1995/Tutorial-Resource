00:00.440 --> 00:05.140
In this video I will demonstrate how to install and configure your logic.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.480
The latest version as of July 2008 80 on Ubuntu operating system.

00:10.770 --> 00:17.490
It has to be noted that the installation process is exactly the same for any other version of us Noon-Air

00:17.630 --> 00:21.450
genetic and legal or others to install groups.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.600
You first need to go to the installation page of Russ..

00:24.630 --> 00:31.150
As of today two versions are he commanded Roskill a dig which was really on May 2006.

00:31.180 --> 00:35.700
The interest which was the lead on making thousand eighty.

00:35.700 --> 00:43.060
Note that both versions have longtime support and yes in this venue we will install the Rossmiller or

00:43.250 --> 00:46.530
melody can be installed on different operating systems.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.610
We will choose your best operating system in our tutorial.

00:49.620 --> 00:56.130
The first thing to know is that trust me logic is only supported by Ubuntu eighteen point zero four

00:56.580 --> 00:58.130
which is Ubuntu by owning.

00:58.230 --> 01:03.090
So make sure that you have installed Ubuntu Byronic before starting the installation.

01:03.270 --> 01:09.870
In the previous video I have shown how to install Ubuntu by onic in a virtual machine on Mac operating

01:09.870 --> 01:10.500
system.

01:10.500 --> 01:17.250
It has to be noted that every version of us is supported by a particular version of Ubuntu that open

01:17.250 --> 01:24.140
a terminal and copy the first command that will accept software from rust packages repository.

01:24.150 --> 01:31.330
After that you need to set up your keys by using the second command before starting the installation.

01:31.560 --> 01:39.300
You'll need to make sure that your daily index is up to date by executing sudo abt get up then the system

01:39.360 --> 01:41.930
update your debian index.

01:41.980 --> 01:47.250
Now your system is ready to install or else there are different available options.

01:47.260 --> 01:54.400
It is recommended to install the desktop option which contains most of the important and required libraries

01:54.400 --> 01:55.090
in the.

01:55.090 --> 01:56.290
Let's do that.

01:56.290 --> 02:02.140
This operation will add a little bit more than 700 megabytes on your hard drive.

02:02.140 --> 02:04.150
The operation takes time.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.040
So wait until it completes

02:12.800 --> 02:13.410
grade.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.300
Now Ross is installed a new system.

02:15.300 --> 02:21.850
However there are still a few more things to do before you can use Rosse you need to initialize that

02:22.740 --> 02:28.500
allows you to easily install system dependencies for sources you want to compile and it is required

02:28.620 --> 02:35.950
to run some core components of Fras then write the command up the congratulations.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.900
You have no roads up and running to enable rest in your system.

02:39.980 --> 02:43.670
You need to source the setup bash of the OS workspace.

02:43.700 --> 02:49.000
Doing so you will be able to run commands to make this effective permanently.

02:49.010 --> 02:59.690
You need to add the command source up trust that's melodic slash set up that bash into bash RC 5 so

02:59.690 --> 03:03.350
that it is enabled automatically whenever you open a new terminal.

03:03.440 --> 03:10.250
So you do not have to manually type it every time you take the last step is to use those tools and other

03:10.250 --> 03:12.950
dependencies to build trust packages.

03:12.950 --> 03:16.670
Now having this done you are ready to start working with Ross.

03:16.690 --> 03:18.600
Apple Ficci installation.

03:18.830 --> 03:23.620
You should create a workspace where to put your proper projects in packages.

03:23.930 --> 03:30.200
For this you need to create a new workspace in the home directory and this what space will be used later

03:30.200 --> 03:34.580
to put all those projects in packages to do so.

03:34.590 --> 03:43.180
Look at the whole factory in an attempt to create a new folder called Get in the US or get your workspace.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.960
And besides why did you create a source file.

03:46.050 --> 03:50.720
Where to put your projects that compile your workspace you see.

03:50.770 --> 03:51.820
You may.

03:51.830 --> 03:58.380
Your face is not to leave other project in to enable your workspace as the default workspace.

03:58.610 --> 04:05.660
You have to source the standard Paschall this workspace into the RC file so open that bash or sci fi

04:05.900 --> 04:07.960
and add the following command inside of it.

04:07.990 --> 04:14.840
Now workspace is ready and you can type Rashidi to make sure that it is the default workspace.
