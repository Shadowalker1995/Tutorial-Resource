In this video I'm going to present some tips and hints for ROS installation.

1
00:05.160 --> 00:11.280
In fact for beginner users one of the most difficult tasks and challenges that face them is how to

2
00:11.280 --> 00:12.930
install ROS effectively.

3
00:12.930 --> 00:18.370
In this video I'm willing to give some recommendations and suggestions to set up rules environment on

4
00:18.390 --> 00:20.460
your machine in the most effective way.

5
00:20.460 --> 00:26.970
I would first start by explaining the different versions and distributions available and how to choose

6
00:27.060 --> 00:31.720
among them then I will discuss the different options possible to install the.

7
00:31.770 --> 00:37.260
And would recommend the best options or Rustie installation and of course anyone who would like to download

8
00:37.260 --> 00:43.230
Droste he has to go to the Ross wiki pages and the first question that someone may ask is which version

9
00:43.260 --> 00:44.610
of us to install.

10
00:44.640 --> 00:51.030
So to know which versions are available you can go to the web page we can trust dot or distributions

11
00:51.120 --> 00:57.510
and here you can find all available distributions since the release of ros in 2000 and that of course

12
00:57.510 --> 01:01.240
you can see some distributions in green and some others in grey.

13
01:01.260 --> 01:09.300
The one with the gray color and then of expired for example Russ G started as expired on May two thousand

14
01:09.660 --> 01:10.410
seventy.

15
01:10.500 --> 01:17.160
So the color can help you to decide which version is not to consider in your installation because it

16
01:17.160 --> 01:22.770
is always good to consider versions for which there is still a technical support and for which there

17
01:22.770 --> 01:25.020
is still some upgrades.

18
01:25.020 --> 01:25.990
This is one point.

19
01:26.010 --> 01:30.100
So the second point here we have four versions that are in green colors.

20
01:30.780 --> 01:39.960
So you must know that for us distributions Some versions have longtime support as and some other verses

21
01:40.140 --> 01:42.740
do not have long term support.

22
01:42.780 --> 01:51.300
For example if you look across the globe the release date is 2014 and the update is 2000 19.

23
01:51.330 --> 01:52.640
So it means five years.

24
01:52.650 --> 01:57.270
So Indigo is one of the versions that has a long term support.

25
01:57.270 --> 01:59.780
Same thing for example for Russky network.

26
01:59.910 --> 02:06.200
It was released in 2016 and we'll be updated until 2:00 until 2021.

27
02:06.240 --> 02:08.540
So you can see for example for us do not.

28
02:08.550 --> 02:16.500
It was released in 2017 but it will be only maintained until 2019 so only here three years.

29
02:16.500 --> 02:21.630
So that is not an LDS version doesn't have a longtime support.

30
02:21.630 --> 02:28.290
However Connecticut has a longtime support and Diego has a longtime support and we can see that the

31
02:28.290 --> 02:38.300
latest version we have now Rosse building it was released on 2000 18 and will expire in 2000 23.

32
02:38.340 --> 02:45.570
So basically now we have three better choices and deagle genetic and.

33
02:45.870 --> 02:51.750
So you can see that here it is recommended to install QinetiQ you may wonder why I probably would say

34
02:51.750 --> 02:54.460
I would like to not know the latest version.

35
02:54.480 --> 02:57.830
So its true that the latest version would be the most up to date.

36
02:57.840 --> 03:04.710
However usually another version would be more stable and contains more packages for example melodic

37
03:04.830 --> 03:11.670
because it was recently released some of the packages could still missing in this version and will require

38
03:11.670 --> 03:13.860
some time until they are released.

39
03:13.950 --> 03:20.880
But for rescue attic since it was released two years ago from the time I'm giving this lecture so it

40
03:20.880 --> 03:26.640
should not be more mature and contains the most comprehensive set of packages.

41
03:26.640 --> 03:31.920
So at this point in time I would recommend to install a rescue network because this is what is currently

42
03:31.920 --> 03:34.030
recommended by US community.

43
03:34.140 --> 03:41.100
However if you install Rossmiller dick or even worse and you go it will be fine for this course and

44
03:41.100 --> 03:43.580
for that you told us that we are going to present here.

45
03:43.590 --> 03:49.720
I just want to mention that we will be having some exercises with total box 3 and rest and the doesn't

46
03:49.740 --> 03:55.820
have packages factored in but 3 test only packages for better but Botros kinetically test packages for

47
03:55.880 --> 03:56.930
all but three.

48
03:57.210 --> 03:58.880
So this is the recommended version.

49
03:58.920 --> 04:04.950
And of course maybe later in time the melodic version will be the one that is recommended.

50
04:04.980 --> 04:11.640
So this is just to have a brief overview of the different distributions and versions available and how

51
04:11.640 --> 04:13.050
to choose among that.

52
04:13.110 --> 04:19.250
So the main recommendation is to choose a version that has a long time support.

53
04:19.260 --> 04:23.160
OK because it's going to be updated for five years.

54
04:23.220 --> 04:29.070
Not like that immediately loses which is just going to be maintained only for two years so the next

55
04:29.070 --> 04:30.990
step is to do the installation.

56
04:30.990 --> 04:38.490
If you want to do the installation of course you can type in Google or US installation and clicking

57
04:38.550 --> 04:43.710
on the first thing is going to redirect you to the latest version.

58
04:43.740 --> 04:51.090
So either you can install QinetiQ which is recommended has long term support LDS support them until

59
04:51.090 --> 04:57.130
2021 or Rowse melodic so I already explained which version to choose.

60
04:57.180 --> 05:00.770
So for example now you can choose this one in this one.

61
05:00.880 --> 05:02.430
It's up to you to decide.

62
05:02.430 --> 05:07.620
And you can select which platform you would like to install.

63
05:07.890 --> 05:13.770
So it is highly recommended to install Windows on Ubuntu although it is said to be working on other

64
05:13.770 --> 05:16.860
operating system like Mac OS and others.

65
05:16.860 --> 05:21.780
Ubuntu is the most stable operating system to install for us.

66
05:21.780 --> 05:30.730
It can also be installed on other Debian like Jesse and 64 or 64 architectures.

67
05:30.780 --> 05:33.650
So here I assume that you have a Ubuntu.

68
05:33.690 --> 05:39.250
And of course now something that you have to think about is that every version of For us it works on

69
05:39.330 --> 05:44.820
specific version of Ubuntu Linux operating system and it is mentioned here for example now.

70
05:44.850 --> 05:48.060
If we look at the page of Russky not.

71
05:48.120 --> 05:54.820
So in this case Ruskin kinetic only supports Ubuntu fifteen point ten and Ubuntu sixteen point four.

72
05:54.870 --> 05:58.060
And just the Debian 8 or the mean packages.

73
05:58.110 --> 06:04.860
So here I would recommend that you consider for QinetiQ to first install Ubuntu operating system 4:16.

74
06:04.880 --> 06:07.420
And this is very easy we can go to Google.

75
06:07.830 --> 06:12.490
OK Ubuntu 16 that there are four.

76
06:12.960 --> 06:20.940
And because Ubuntu 16 to 4 is also Ethie as version it has also a longtime support in Ubuntu and you

77
06:20.940 --> 06:21.810
can download here.

78
06:21.820 --> 06:26.970
The image is either on your physical machine or on your virtual machine.

79
06:26.970 --> 06:29.690
I'm going to explain a little bit more.

80
06:29.970 --> 06:34.630
The concept of virtual machine and why it is more appropriate for installing grass.

81
06:34.740 --> 06:40.920
OK so if for example you go to another version like the latest one melodic go to your bento.

82
06:40.970 --> 06:42.780
OK so hit this page.

83
06:42.790 --> 06:49.200
We could not find information about which Ubuntu version is appropriate for us melodic but looking to

84
06:49.230 --> 06:50.180
another page here.

85
06:50.190 --> 06:57.510
So it is said that melodic is primarily targeted for Ubuntu eighteen point five by only to release all

86
06:57.510 --> 07:00.630
the other Linux system as well as mapquest and Android.

87
07:00.630 --> 07:02.820
Windows are supported to trying to get.

88
07:02.910 --> 07:08.800
So here it will be appropriate to install it on Aikens you also 17.

89
07:08.880 --> 07:13.050
So this is how to choose your operating system and your own version.

90
07:13.050 --> 07:19.050
So if you want to install a host and legal which is also possible in this case it is only supported

91
07:19.050 --> 07:22.340
by thirteen point 10 and 14 point zero for that.

92
07:22.620 --> 07:27.770
So in this case I would recommend to use 40 points for if you want to work with any other dimension.

93
07:27.820 --> 07:31.160
Choosing any of these three versions would be the same thing.

94
07:31.170 --> 07:36.810
Considering all that you told is that you are going to develop your work exactly the same on any of

95
07:36.810 --> 07:38.090
the versions.

96
07:38.310 --> 07:43.110
So now you have understood the difference between different versions of Ross.

97
07:43.110 --> 07:46.880
Now the next question is how to install and work to installers.

98
07:46.880 --> 07:49.110
So here you have two different options.

99
07:49.110 --> 07:50.640
First of all you can have.

100
07:50.670 --> 07:56.140
You can install Ubuntu on a physical machine and then you proceed to the installation for us.

101
07:56.190 --> 08:01.440
As mentioned here in this tutorial However this approach is not recommended.

102
08:01.440 --> 08:08.460
The reason is when you work with us it is possible for any kind of reason that your system got problems

103
08:08.520 --> 08:12.750
or get damaged and in some cases maybe it will start to work correctly.

104
08:12.870 --> 08:18.840
And this we are required to do a complete reinstallation of the whole system which is very time consuming

105
08:18.930 --> 08:20.430
and a very tedious operation.

106
08:20.460 --> 08:25.060
So instead of installing Ubuntu and underdose on a physical machine.

107
08:25.140 --> 08:28.880
The other alternative is to install it on a virtual machine.

108
08:28.920 --> 08:36.910
So for example like in my case I am working on Mac operating system and as you can see I have been to

109
08:36.970 --> 08:44.400
virtual machine that is running on top of my operating system so this can be done by installing a virtual

110
08:44.400 --> 08:51.240
machine software and then installing Ubuntu on these virtual machine and finally installing grass on

111
08:51.240 --> 08:52.000
the virtual machine.

112
08:52.000 --> 08:57.570
So for example if you work with Mac OS do this case you can download fusion software.

113
08:57.600 --> 09:00.000
So fusion done is a good time machine.

114
09:00.000 --> 09:06.150
It's not free but it is very convenient to work with the virtual machine on Mac OS so you can download

115
09:06.150 --> 09:11.300
it from here install it and then you will have an interface similar to this one.

116
09:11.370 --> 09:15.130
OK so you can see I have two beautiful machines installed.

117
09:15.210 --> 09:16.910
So what you can do in this case.

118
09:17.040 --> 09:23.810
After of course after downloading Ubuntu version of your choice for example either you download sixteen

119
09:23.810 --> 09:31.200
point zero for if you want to install schematics ethics or you download eighteen point zero four if

120
09:31.200 --> 09:33.120
you want to install Rossmiller.

121
09:33.210 --> 09:40.470
After that you will use the virtual machine software to install the operating system so you can create

122
09:40.930 --> 09:47.400
the new virtual machine and then select the option install from disk or image you continue then the

123
09:47.400 --> 09:51.590
file that you will not load from Ubuntu which is the operating system image.

124
09:51.600 --> 09:57.620
You will it and paste it here and then let the system go into the operating system is fully installed

125
09:57.780 --> 09:58.890
on your virtual machine.

126
09:58.900 --> 10:04.950
Once the done you will be able to have a virtual machine similar to this one in which you can work with

127
10:04.960 --> 10:11.120
it as you are working with a physical machine running Ubuntu operating system.

128
10:11.430 --> 10:18.720
So now if you want to install the truss you open a terminal and then go through the installation page

129
10:19.470 --> 10:22.470
and finally follow the steps one by one.

130
10:23.760 --> 10:24.800
All of the steps here.

131
10:24.810 --> 10:32.790
So here you are recommended to install the full desktop full version using the commands to do a pretty

132
10:32.790 --> 10:36.300
good install so you just need to copy this command here.

133
10:36.450 --> 10:41.820
And so you can see I can do it on my virtual machine.

134
10:42.300 --> 10:47.900
So I have already installed but is going to upgrade some of the packages so you install this version

135
10:47.910 --> 10:48.880
desktop for.

136
10:49.410 --> 10:55.470
And then you follow the different steps to initialize those dependencies and setting up the environment

137
10:55.560 --> 11:04.190
exactly like it is explained here and that's pretty much all you'll have are as kinetic or any other

138
11:04.420 --> 11:10.600
version installed on your computer and you can do that that audience in a later video.

139
11:10.600 --> 11:16.150
I'm going to explain to you how to get the files that we will use in this course if you are working

140
11:16.270 --> 11:18.130
on Windows machine.

141
11:18.220 --> 11:26.140
In this case you cannot download VM fusion because this is for Mac operating systems but you can download

142
11:26.620 --> 11:31.750
the workstation Pro which is the other four windows machine.

143
11:31.750 --> 11:36.840
And the process is exactly the same as the one that they have explained or Mac OS.

144
11:36.880 --> 11:42.700
So if you don't want to bother yourself with installing grass and if you want to save your time and

145
11:42.710 --> 11:49.740
teach your a student in this course I can give you a virtual machine with schematics that contains us

146
11:49.800 --> 11:54.660
already installed in all the different files that you need to follow these tutorials.

147
11:54.670 --> 12:00.190
So if you want to get a copy of the virtual machine just send me a request through the ME Web site and

148
12:00.190 --> 12:01.270
they will send you the link.

149
12:01.290 --> 12:04.500
All those virtual machine so that you can start right.

150
12:04.510 --> 12:08.440
We weren't going to use without spending time on the installations.
