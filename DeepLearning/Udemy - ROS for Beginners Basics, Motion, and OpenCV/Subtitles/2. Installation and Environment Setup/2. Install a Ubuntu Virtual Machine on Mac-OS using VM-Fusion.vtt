It don't want to make you this video.

00:06.400 --> 00:12.910
I'm going to show how to install Ubuntu operating system on a virtual machine for a Mac OS operating

00:12.910 --> 00:13.600
system.

00:13.600 --> 00:18.040
In fact my advice and recommendation it is always highly recommended.

00:18.430 --> 00:25.290
Working on a virtual machine because you can set up all your environment install applications all your

00:25.390 --> 00:31.170
integrated development environment only once and then you can start the fight of the virtual machine

00:31.540 --> 00:33.540
in any external hard drive.

00:33.700 --> 00:39.980
So later on in any case when there is a damage that happens to your virtual machine for example Rowse

00:40.240 --> 00:46.930
installation is compromised or something doesn't work fine after some updates and so one you can easily

00:46.930 --> 00:54.770
get back to your working environment by just getting a copy of your same little machine and open it

00:54.760 --> 00:55.230
again.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.630
However if you work on a physical machine.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.300
If there is any problem with your system you have to install everything from scratch.

01:02.470 --> 01:06.350
And this is sometimes very time consuming and tedious operation.

01:06.430 --> 01:14.240
So this demonstration is going to show how to install Ubuntu 18 0 4 on a virtual machine.

01:14.410 --> 01:19.740
However the process will be exactly the same if you install any other version of Ubuntu.

01:19.840 --> 01:26.580
So the first thing that you have to do is to go to Ubuntu website the only WW Ubuntu Look-Up slush.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.350
No lossless desktop.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.620
So you will download the desktop version of Ubuntu.

01:31.720 --> 01:37.240
You click on Golo then you access the file and let it download completely on your system.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.780
It's going to take a little bit of time depending on the speed of your connection.

01:41.800 --> 01:48.370
So after that if you have Mac operating system you can use any software a virtual machine you can use

01:48.430 --> 01:52.080
Freep options like your tool box from Aurukun which is free.

01:52.150 --> 01:58.690
But my recommendation is to use fusion virtual machine from VM way which provides very powerful functionalities

01:58.840 --> 01:59.650
very stable.

01:59.690 --> 02:00.830
But the problem is speed.

02:00.850 --> 02:06.240
So you have fusion you up and fusion and then you create a new virtual machine.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.190
You still have the option install from the disk or an image.

02:09.220 --> 02:16.300
Then you drag and paste the operating system image that you have downloaded and then follow the instructions.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.870
So you have to set the password for the virtual machine.

02:19.030 --> 02:24.550
You can also check the option make your home folder accessible to the virtual machine and then click

02:24.550 --> 02:25.360
Continue.

02:25.630 --> 02:31.030
So you can choose install but I recommend that you customize your setting before going further.

02:31.030 --> 02:36.190
First of all you have to give a name to the virtual machine and then you can change the setting on the

02:36.190 --> 02:36.820
virtual machine.

02:36.820 --> 02:43.150
For example you would like to increase the number of processors are at the butyl machine and the memory

02:43.660 --> 02:46.340
or any other setting like network settings or other.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.230
So you can do that.

02:47.230 --> 02:50.100
For example I would choose to have 4 processors.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.410
Unfortunately Off-Ramp.

02:51.460 --> 02:57.400
Of course this depends on the capabilities of your machine and then that it is done so the installation

02:57.400 --> 03:03.370
takes a little bit of time and then the virtual memory having the Ubuntu operating system is going to

03:03.460 --> 03:08.950
open and you can just type your password that you have set initially and finally you will be logging

03:09.010 --> 03:14.800
in with the virtual machine and you will have your bent operating system where you can install Russ

03:14.920 --> 03:16.960
and configure your environment over that.

03:17.080 --> 03:23.530
So after having the virtual machine installed you can install the Russ install your favorite integrated

03:23.530 --> 03:24.680
development environment.

03:24.850 --> 03:30.910
Like for example eclipse or visio pseudocode or any other ID of your choice.

03:30.910 --> 03:34.260
Install all the other libraries that you need for close.

03:34.260 --> 03:40.490
For example Total what packages for any packages that you need for sensors actuators or anything and

03:40.490 --> 03:46.200
then make a copy of your virtual machine with it on an external hard drive just in case.

03:46.210 --> 03:53.380
If you have any crash or any problem you can get back to a built in machine up and running without the

03:53.380 --> 03:57.030
need to install Ros and all the tools that you have already installed.
