00:00.300 --> 00:06.240
In this video I'm going to talk about which integrated development environment would be better to use

00:06.240 --> 00:09.600
with Ross usually especially for new users.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.020
They face the difficulty to decide which development environment to use to develop with us.

00:15.030 --> 00:20.210
There are different alternatives so I'm willing to discuss a few of them in this video.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.650
The first possible option is to use Eclipse so here when you open eclipse you need to open it in the

00:25.650 --> 00:33.310
cut clean workspace so you have to choose the cutting workspace here and then you have to meet here

00:33.650 --> 00:35.970
in the beginning when I started develop with Ross.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.310
I usually use Eclipse very often.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.520
It's a very nice development environment.

00:40.710 --> 00:43.600
However it's a little bit slow and a bit heavy.

00:43.710 --> 00:49.980
So there are other alternatives I'm going to show a little bit later so you can actually develop in

00:49.980 --> 00:54.350
Python you can develop in C++.

00:54.540 --> 01:01.470
Over there are some configurations that you need to do to configure it needs to work with your workspace.

01:01.470 --> 01:07.230
Let me make a demonstration on a new workspace so I'm going to close this one because it's already configured

01:07.770 --> 01:09.930
so let's create a new workspace.

01:09.930 --> 01:12.730
Just test how to up an eclipse with it.

01:12.780 --> 01:16.800
I'm going to call it Myra's workspace.

01:16.880 --> 01:28.350
Does associate know I'm going to then make so now our workspace is created so after creating the workspace

01:28.380 --> 01:30.990
we need to create an Eclipse project inside.

01:30.990 --> 01:37.320
And for this we're going to use the following command we execute this command here and now we have an

01:37.320 --> 01:39.450
Eclipse project created.

01:39.450 --> 01:44.140
So now I'm ready to use Eclipse to work in my new cat keen workspace.

01:44.170 --> 01:51.940
So I'm going to open eclipse now and then I have to browse and select the new workspace.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.710
Now you can see what you offer the workspace.

01:53.710 --> 01:59.080
There is no project so we need to import the project use import.

01:59.480 --> 02:07.240
You go to join the existing projects into workspace and then you have to browse and select the root

02:07.360 --> 02:08.130
directory.

02:08.470 --> 02:11.950
So here pay attention that little directory is the big directory.

02:11.950 --> 02:22.830
So we have to select be less okay and then finish and then we will see that we have this is our source

02:22.830 --> 02:24.380
directly for the moment.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.380
We don't have any project here.

02:27.570 --> 02:29.820
We can create a new package for example.

02:29.940 --> 02:36.930
So let's create a new package I need to go to the source for work and then I'm going to create a package

02:37.050 --> 02:40.240
digging tutorials so you can give it any name.

02:40.420 --> 02:45.140
So the package is now created and then we need to do a cat can.

02:45.240 --> 02:52.220
So I use the shortcuts the M which is an alias that they made to the command I can make.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.560
So I do cat can make now and our project is now compiled.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.230
So if I refresh.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.100
We're going to find our package big in the toilet here.

03:01.170 --> 03:05.390
So now you can create any file you can create to find in Python.

03:06.010 --> 03:06.380
OK.

03:06.390 --> 03:14.940
For example you can create a file listener that by and write your code over here.

03:14.940 --> 03:19.280
You can create some BP files you have you have the see make list at the extremes.

03:19.320 --> 03:23.840
Now you can develop your program or you can add a new program using Eclipse.

03:23.850 --> 03:27.850
So this is how to configure eclipse to work in that environment.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.270
Another editor that you can also use is to blame.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.250
So you blame me as a lightweight editor.

03:33.300 --> 03:38.720
So actually you can take your whole project and rugged into the cage workspace.

03:38.730 --> 03:40.950
So for example here we have different packages.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.000
I'm going to take this one.

03:42.030 --> 03:42.790
Bring it here.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.230
Then you have all the different files saleable.

03:45.260 --> 03:45.550
Okay.

03:45.570 --> 03:51.280
So for example you can program in C++ and you can also program in Python nicely.

03:51.450 --> 03:57.690
So now for example if you want to execute any program for example I want to execute the Tucker and the

03:57.690 --> 03:58.070
listener.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.120
Now I'm in the package right.

04:00.300 --> 04:10.310
Trading so I'm going to make the world a score and then of course restaurant during less training and

04:10.310 --> 04:12.660
then I'll cut that out.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.460
So of course you can modify using the sublime Ed and then you can write using a terminal.

04:18.900 --> 04:19.640
So it's sublime.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.670
There is no integrated terminal.

04:23.130 --> 04:33.780
And that's why my actually favorite editor is visit a studio called visual studio code is another alternative

04:33.810 --> 04:42.180
that you can use in order to program with Russ in two parts C++ Python and different programming languages.

04:43.030 --> 04:43.490
Okay.

04:43.490 --> 04:46.710
And it works pretty much the same way as sublime.

04:47.580 --> 04:53.700
So for example if I open a new window and they would like to put some projects here I will do in the

04:53.700 --> 04:56.580
same way I'm going to take this one for example.

04:56.580 --> 05:04.410
Let me take a take it you another one I'll put it here and then you will have all the files.

05:04.410 --> 05:04.970
OK.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.350
So you have this listener and this is staggered by.

05:09.480 --> 05:16.070
And the good thing that I like here is that you have an integrated terminal so you can write your code

05:16.850 --> 05:19.070
over here integrated so you.

05:19.730 --> 05:23.660
Another alternative is to open another extension terminal like this.

05:23.680 --> 05:32.390
But it probably year or any appropriate place but also it is very convenient to use this integrated

05:32.390 --> 05:36.590
terminal whenever you want to run some programs like for example what you can do.

05:36.590 --> 05:43.890
You can have a really low score running here and then you can put all our comments here so I can make

05:43.910 --> 05:46.210
this topic list.

05:46.250 --> 05:52.810
So I have a rough score running and then I can run my programs from here.

05:52.820 --> 05:57.230
Let me run again to tell her the fight that is going to run.

05:57.710 --> 06:02.590
So this integrated tempura is a nice feature in the visual pseudocode.

06:02.710 --> 06:10.520
The layout is also nice and simple to use and it is lightweight as compared to eclipse for example it

06:10.520 --> 06:13.310
is a much lighter weight.

06:13.310 --> 06:18.890
So I would recommend to use visual to your content of course you can use any editor of your choice.

06:18.890 --> 06:24.310
These are just some suggestions that may help you select an appropriate development environment for

06:24.310 --> 06:24.460
you.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.790
Ross projects.
