00:00.230 --> 00:05.400
In the previous video I have introduced launch heights and how to create a large file with multiple

00:05.400 --> 00:07.210
notes in this video.

00:07.230 --> 00:13.050
I'm going to show how we can extend the lounge vised by including some existing large files and also

00:13.170 --> 00:16.930
specifying some parameters that you can use inside the No.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.570
So let's see how that works.

00:18.570 --> 00:23.670
So in the previous video I have introduced the turtle see underskirt video of the flash which contains

00:23.670 --> 00:25.250
two different notes.

00:25.270 --> 00:32.420
Now to consider the other five code to see underscore when or where we are going to use the little note

00:32.430 --> 00:36.670
that we have defined in the previous section of them that can see motion.

00:36.930 --> 00:43.390
In addition to that we are going to include the last five that we have defined and which is called 13

00:43.390 --> 00:44.730
sim underscored Gilleo.

00:44.940 --> 00:49.290
So that gives seen underscore the computer will contain all the notes of this classified.

00:49.410 --> 00:52.880
Plus one more note that is got the cleaner.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.190
So how to do that.

00:54.210 --> 00:57.580
Now we are excited to see him and the skull clean or Nash.

00:57.840 --> 01:03.890
So we can add the additional note in the same way that we did before.

01:03.990 --> 01:09.100
So this is the node it belongs to the package or essential CBP.

01:09.210 --> 01:15.200
So basically I'm going to use the note that you have defined it here which is called Total simply that

01:15.480 --> 01:18.920
by which is defined in that package.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.840
Are those essential CBP dispatches that we are using during this course.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.840
And then the task of the node is called courtesy and that can be done by.

01:28.980 --> 01:36.370
This is the note that we have defined before and which makes the robot move go to go locations and perform

01:36.530 --> 01:37.640
unique applications.

01:37.800 --> 01:44.700
So yeah were going just to ask the robot to go to the code 1 1 for x and y coordinates and then said

01:44.710 --> 01:50.790
that these are location 290 and then move forward with Chinglish to forward.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.430
Thats what we want to do here in the community.

01:54.630 --> 01:57.250
So we put everything together into the lungs.

01:57.470 --> 02:03.000
And the new thing here is that were going to include the last fire that we have defined previously which

02:03.000 --> 02:06.680
is Coltart to see underscore the latch.

02:06.780 --> 02:09.030
So we will use that that include.

02:09.210 --> 02:12.480
And then we specify the location of the flight.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.540
And for this we are going to use the command fine.

02:15.870 --> 02:23.040
Okay fine dress as such a you pick and this one it is going to return the absolute path of the package.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.990
Host essentials BP is Ysidro essential to BP.

02:26.990 --> 02:36.170
We have asked the public to motion slush slush symp underscore the deep dark Lodge which is the fact

02:36.180 --> 02:40.280
that we have defined over here which is located in this location.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.130
So we have such a CVP this is that package name.

02:44.130 --> 02:53.650
And this is now the path to the package home workspace at c and be then we go to the s RC for the then

02:53.820 --> 02:56.450
top into motion and then that.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.590
And now we have we're going to import or to include that to see.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.400
And the scope hope that lush.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.340
So not the.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.280
Is going to start.

03:05.280 --> 03:11.910
Both the previous five courtesy undercut the up and also an additional note which is called the ductless

03:12.150 --> 03:13.350
underscore cleaner.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.010
Don't buy it.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.640
Now let's get to this.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.560
No.

03:18.040 --> 03:18.390
OK.

03:18.390 --> 03:22.330
Can you trust launch are those assumptions CBP.

03:22.440 --> 03:28.210
And then we're going to use the steam cleaner flush.

03:28.450 --> 03:36.010
And here you can see it's going to go to the location 1 1 and at the same time I can also Les Miserables

03:36.010 --> 03:43.220
it using the keyboard for an hour later the time is taking control over the robot.

03:43.280 --> 03:48.020
Now I can also do some additional controls with the keyboard.

03:48.140 --> 03:48.600
OK.

03:48.640 --> 03:54.680
I'm now rotating with the keyboard as you can see now and fully control immediately one of the end of

03:54.680 --> 03:56.900
the it is simply not a right.

03:57.200 --> 04:06.050
OK so two notes were actually around the same time because we have it we did the tortoise and the scope

04:06.230 --> 04:07.080
of the flash.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.520
Also we have the underscore at the back.

04:10.640 --> 04:19.670
So you observe that when you have started this node or this fire in the beginning this would have started

04:19.670 --> 04:21.390
to go to this location.

04:21.570 --> 04:22.620
Wow what.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.220
OK.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.700
Which was the frame here.

04:24.950 --> 04:31.670
You that that is simply imagine that now I would like to start at some different locations.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.820
I'd not want the robot to go to a location one one for example.

04:34.820 --> 04:38.370
I want to go to some other locations one of the ways.

04:38.460 --> 04:42.440
What do you find is manually here and then execute the program.

04:42.450 --> 04:50.720
And another way is actually to define parameters inside the Lonsway and then collect these parameters

04:50.970 --> 04:54.560
from your node.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.950
So let's see how it works.

04:56.970 --> 05:02.070
Now imagine that instead of setting specifically the value of the x and y coordinates of the goldbricking

05:02.070 --> 05:05.680
should we want to get them as part of inters from the fight.

05:05.970 --> 05:14.430
So for example here I'm going to define an X goal location which will be equal to some parameter value

05:14.670 --> 05:16.090
and the Y.

05:16.290 --> 05:21.360
And there's got a good location but also the equity the perimeter and the bottom and that needs to be

05:21.360 --> 05:23.520
defined into the last fight first.

05:23.550 --> 05:29.270
So I'm going to go to the last fight and yet I'm going to be fine but I'm.

05:29.550 --> 05:37.000
And then give a name to the bottom and the name of the I'm OK will be used later on to select this parameter

05:37.350 --> 05:38.430
in the Peiffer node.

05:38.610 --> 05:42.940
And then for example let me call in just like the name of the variable x goal.

05:43.660 --> 05:49.830
And we set the value the value for example equal to three point zero.

05:50.630 --> 05:51.070
OK.

05:51.120 --> 05:55.310
So this is the part I'm I'm going to do another parameter for the Y location.

05:55.650 --> 05:59.430
OK you can define any of the parameters that you want.

05:59.430 --> 06:06.020
And for example let me put this to what so remember in the code here.

06:06.150 --> 06:11.430
You have used one one location so I'm going to change it with execute and we know we have defined the

06:11.480 --> 06:16.900
parameter and you have to make sure to define the parameter before the node is called.

06:17.040 --> 06:23.550
So that these parameters are added as you said into the parameter server so that we can retrieve them

06:23.610 --> 06:28.990
from the underscore number by some code.

06:29.130 --> 06:34.350
And now the second step after defining the bottom of the downside we need to collect these parameters

06:34.420 --> 06:37.040
from the snow and to do so.

06:37.080 --> 06:45.600
We will use respire that get squat from and then you have to specify the name so the name of the apartment

06:45.600 --> 06:47.620
that was ex go.

06:47.820 --> 06:56.820
So I'm going to use X go here to specify the name of the author and the same thing would be our that's

06:56.940 --> 06:59.520
why go.

07:00.130 --> 07:00.770
OK.

07:01.110 --> 07:09.520
And now instead of using these static by use I can use your X goal which we did it from the file.

07:09.570 --> 07:12.220
And my goal would be that come along.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.090
Right.

07:13.510 --> 07:22.450
And then also here in the back you make read X gold and use your X and those cortico.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.380
OK.

07:23.550 --> 07:31.520
And then also the like of course in order to display this in the large file we need to set the output

07:33.450 --> 07:40.910
to screen I'll put it in use it's getting so that the output.

07:41.600 --> 07:46.580
Not everything is in place I can try to run the code.

07:46.850 --> 07:55.380
OK I'm going to use those sources and then that I would find this God and see him know the clutch now

07:57.490 --> 08:03.230
he's going to start the turtle him and now is going to go to the location 3 7.

08:03.310 --> 08:11.180
So if we look at the X not x is equal to 3 and Y is equal to 7.

08:11.690 --> 08:16.800
So the value now is taking.

08:17.510 --> 08:22.100
OK so you can see now we have successively added the third in the third into our last five.

08:22.370 --> 08:26.530
And this is the way how you can connect the parameter into the Rossmo.

08:26.600 --> 08:33.350
This is indeed very practical because instead of changing every time the code manually you just need

08:33.350 --> 08:35.860
to set your parameters into the launch right.

08:36.050 --> 08:42.240
So at the end you can see it as very effective to execute multiple notes by just calling only one type

08:42.270 --> 08:45.520
instead of slamming multiple notes into different.
