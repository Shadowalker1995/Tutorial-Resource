00:00.230 --> 00:03.450
Learn a lot of people so that there was more than a venum comedy audience.

00:03.460 --> 00:10.560
I mean if this is your I'm going to present launch fights Indras those fights are very important.

00:10.560 --> 00:16.420
In particular if you have many programs to imagine that you have several nodes and you want to run that.

00:16.420 --> 00:22.110
So what you have been doing so far is we open a terminal and we use the restaurant to open every node

00:22.200 --> 00:23.460
in a separate them.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.440
This becomes really cumbersome when we have a lot of notes to open at the same time.

00:28.620 --> 00:35.880
Fortunately in the there are large files which allow you to define several nodes which can be executed

00:35.940 --> 00:36.820
all at once.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.550
So let's see how it works before going into the coding part.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.310
Let's understand what is a long fight.

00:43.320 --> 00:50.630
So olanzapine is nothing but an excellent document which specifies if you thinks it specifies what are

00:50.640 --> 00:53.310
the notes that we execute.

00:53.310 --> 00:58.230
It also specifies some of the parameters that we can collect into the notes.

00:58.230 --> 01:05.450
And also it can include some other existing launch fights in order to run a large file.

01:05.550 --> 01:10.670
We can use the command or a slash like we use Roussillon for executing a node.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.080
We use the commanders.

01:12.080 --> 01:17.670
Now that is a program that easily launches multiple rows of notes that are defined in the lunchtime

01:18.180 --> 01:22.760
and by convention the last viage would have a large extension.

01:22.770 --> 01:31.300
Now let's go to the coding I'm now to show the importance and usability of Rumsfeld's other simple example

01:31.300 --> 01:32.750
using the simulator.

01:32.770 --> 01:38.190
But of course you can extend and generalize the use of lost files with any Rusnak.

01:38.530 --> 01:43.980
So remember that you have the same cleaner application that you have the before.

01:44.140 --> 01:47.410
And now imagine that I would like to open a simulator.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.950
So first of all I need to start the score.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.200
This is a first terminal that you have to open or to start with Scott.

01:54.670 --> 02:02.560
And then I need to open a second terminal where I on the simulator turtle theme and then that's you

02:02.560 --> 02:03.250
know.

02:03.610 --> 02:09.520
OK so this is a second term and if I want to open a third note for example making the operation of the

02:09.520 --> 02:18.120
robot I need to open a third then we don't use ingress to run then our third scheme and then it's the.

02:18.290 --> 02:19.230
And that's Kartini up.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.410
This is the third node.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.280
So I can use the oars to make more.

02:23.410 --> 02:29.440
And if I want to open my own program which is called turtled simply or I need to open a fourth 10 minute

02:29.810 --> 02:34.990
run which is not interest is such a city B then turtle seem greener.

02:35.080 --> 02:40.790
But back then I was going to exit at the second is going to go to this location here.

02:42.600 --> 02:47.790
So you can see I had to open so many terminals and of course if I have programs to open I need to open

02:48.270 --> 02:52.830
more and more terminals which is very cumbersome and not very efficient.

02:52.830 --> 02:59.570
So instead of doing that we can simplify the process by defining large fights.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.540
So let's see how it works.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.800
I'm going to stop programs.

03:02.890 --> 03:05.760
Let be just move somewhere.

03:06.060 --> 03:12.870
I'm going to stop the whole programs and instead of running four different nodes into four different

03:12.870 --> 03:16.090
10 minutes I can define a lunch right.

03:16.620 --> 03:23.720
So here we have lunch like go to the scene of which just happen to notice.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.860
So we're going to open the turtle.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.900
Note and also the opening.

03:28.050 --> 03:28.470
OK.

03:28.530 --> 03:39.090
So remember here we have often the turtle C note and we have also opened the deli up no the last five

03:39.130 --> 03:43.240
is actually an extremely fine that starts with the tag lounge.

03:43.360 --> 03:50.230
And we also finish with a top lounge and beside the lounge that we can define several notes using the

03:50.230 --> 03:56.310
tag node and the year that I've noticed has several parameters like the package name.

03:56.530 --> 03:59.480
OK so here we make restaurant.

03:59.710 --> 04:02.690
Then we call the package name.

04:03.270 --> 04:03.890
OK.

04:03.970 --> 04:13.330
So the packaging needs to see and then the type is actually the node name OK.

04:13.340 --> 04:18.300
So the no need here is called the C underscore Nazis is the name of the package.

04:18.410 --> 04:20.330
And this is the name of the node.

04:20.570 --> 04:21.140
OK.

04:21.140 --> 04:25.880
That you are going to start or the type of the node we're going to start and then we can give a custom

04:25.900 --> 04:30.900
name OK we can give a custom name so that Nicolete and we can call it.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.920
And it's sort of this the symbol.

04:33.110 --> 04:39.360
So this is the name of the note when we execute the note we're going to assign the following name in

04:39.520 --> 04:45.350
the initialiser is going to use this name for the particular note that you will execute.

04:46.570 --> 04:46.950
OK.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.940
And then in the same file I'm going to start of the tally up in the same way.

04:50.950 --> 04:58.030
We're going to use the time note and then the package name which is also 30 C and then the type of the

04:58.030 --> 05:05.670
node it use turtle Eliakim just this one and then we going to assign a name for the node which is called

05:05.710 --> 05:07.830
the turtle into your name.

05:08.080 --> 05:18.220
Now instead of running these for 10 minutes I can run these two notes OK just by launching this number

05:18.450 --> 05:24.670
that is up and the school lunch for this I not need even to underscore because when we use the rest

05:24.670 --> 05:26.910
now it's going to start to score.

05:26.950 --> 05:34.940
If it is not already started and then this does seem that now it's defined in our package or as such.

05:35.020 --> 05:37.170
This is the name of the package where it is defined.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.250
And I do find it either.

05:39.370 --> 05:44.300
So if you look at the workspace as I see this is essential CPB.

05:44.550 --> 05:45.420
OK.

05:45.490 --> 05:48.780
And then this is the SAAC in topic to motion.

05:48.850 --> 05:54.820
We had lunch and then we were going to start this lunch right.

05:54.820 --> 05:59.960
So this violence is actually belongs to essential CBP.

06:00.280 --> 06:06.730
So now I'm going to make Ross the sensors separately and then I can see that they have many large files

06:06.730 --> 06:12.450
I'm going to use the one that they have just declined which is called See daily job.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.660
And here is going to start two notes.

06:15.820 --> 06:19.140
So it has already started the turtle C simulator.

06:19.310 --> 06:22.720
And in addition to this it has already started later.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.830
Low key so we can verify that.

06:26.100 --> 06:26.840
OK.

06:28.340 --> 06:35.350
You can see know I'm able to control the motion using the DeLeo we can verify the name of the notes

06:35.470 --> 06:37.810
using Krasnow.

06:39.100 --> 06:45.280
And you can see now the note and you start to see underscore no this is the name of the note that we

06:45.280 --> 06:50.560
have a sign in the fight we can find it out in the snow just yet.

06:50.650 --> 06:52.540
And also they simply are not.

06:52.540 --> 06:56.100
This is the other name that you have the same as in a.
