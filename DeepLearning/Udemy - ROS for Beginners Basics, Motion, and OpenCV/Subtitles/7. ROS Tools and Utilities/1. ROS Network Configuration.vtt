00:00.430 --> 00:05.580
Schoolwork Mannerheim muscle it was Salom want to be me.

00:05.820 --> 00:12.570
So in this video tutorial I'm going to show how to make the network configuration between the body machine

00:12.600 --> 00:16.210
or a robot machine and a workstation.

00:16.500 --> 00:25.440
So the objective is to allow so is to allow a workstation to control a robot remotely through the network.

00:25.500 --> 00:29.460
And for this we need to do a small number of operations.

00:29.910 --> 00:36.730
So we have here in the left side we have a virtual machine that represents the workstation and here

00:36.810 --> 00:42.250
on the right side have another machine that represents the robot machine itself.

00:42.300 --> 00:47.320
So first of all we are going to do some changes in the machine or see phyto.

00:47.370 --> 00:51.570
I'm going to open it up to see in the workstation.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.130
OK.

00:52.200 --> 00:58.760
And here I'm going to up with rush of see into the robot machine.

00:59.160 --> 01:06.890
Ok so in the robot machine here we need to add some configuration we need to export the rest must that

01:06.910 --> 01:08.020
you and I.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.860
So these are environment variables.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.680
So that's my story you right.

01:12.810 --> 01:15.610
Rose is going to run on the robot machine.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.490
So the roast master is going to run into the local host of the robot machines.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.840
That's why he can host and this is the default port number.

01:26.730 --> 01:29.840
And then also we need to specify the hostname Rosati.

01:29.850 --> 01:34.870
These are environment variables related to the host environment.

01:34.950 --> 01:36.290
So those hostname.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.040
And when we put the IP either.

01:38.040 --> 01:43.380
So we need to find what is the IP address of the robot first.

01:43.380 --> 01:54.180
So I'm going to make it stick until we find that this is the IP address where it H-1 it and the other

01:54.480 --> 01:57.220
interfaces depending on your network configuration.

01:57.450 --> 02:06.410
So when you find the IP address you have to change it accordingly into the bastard.

02:06.510 --> 02:10.110
So I remind that we are now into the robot machine.

02:10.230 --> 02:14.580
We have to change those hostname in the Rose IP environment variables.

02:14.650 --> 02:18.020
According to the IP address of the robot.

02:18.240 --> 02:26.040
So and then these three lines it allows us to display the environment variables that have said so to

02:26.040 --> 02:29.050
make sure that they are correct.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.840
And once it's don't have to open a new terminal.

02:33.570 --> 02:39.930
So when we open a new terminal you're going to have the Russos team and the IP address according to

02:40.500 --> 02:42.670
what we already know.

02:42.780 --> 02:46.840
So we have to make sure that it corresponds to the real us.

02:46.980 --> 02:51.220
So now we have competing with the configuration of the robot machine.

02:51.300 --> 02:55.030
We will do almost the same with the workstation.

02:55.290 --> 03:05.540
So first of all we need to open another and find the IP address so we can find the IP address is monitored

03:05.600 --> 03:12.130
to I'm going to take this and we do the same thing we need to explore.

03:12.190 --> 03:21.970
Ross IP so I'm going to expose IP to the other side just to change this value and that what is very

03:21.970 --> 03:29.330
important we need to specify the correct we need to specify the correct rules must right.

03:29.410 --> 03:39.560
So remember that what is going to run on a robot machine that has an IP address 1 2 6 8 8 8 1 1.

03:39.910 --> 03:48.610
So he it must be 1 9 2 2 1 6 8 8 8 and 1 0 1.

03:48.610 --> 03:53.930
So it corresponds to the IP address of this machine.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.010
OK.

03:55.180 --> 03:58.970
So maybe it's the IP address of the workstation.

03:59.090 --> 04:02.080
Rush hostname is the IP address of the workstation.

04:02.320 --> 04:10.730
And most M.D what I referred to the IP address of the robot machine here.

04:11.040 --> 04:11.470
OK.

04:11.490 --> 04:19.720
So as you can see your last message you're right is going to run on the local host of narrowboat machine.

04:20.910 --> 04:26.380
Ok so now if we are going to test if everything is running fine.

04:26.820 --> 04:28.350
OK I'm going to open

04:35.160 --> 04:37.880
it close and open again.

04:37.950 --> 04:42.210
So we have also those of us here showing one or two.

04:42.350 --> 04:42.670
OK.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.000
And then those mustardy you are cream.

04:45.090 --> 04:49.200
One of the robot machines now let's run Rowse on the robot machine.

04:49.200 --> 05:02.150
I'm going to watch for moggy and on another meaning let me down the road that I'm seeing that is ignored.

05:03.690 --> 05:07.370
So now I have Russ running on Robert Mashi.

05:07.650 --> 05:11.070
I can do a rose LOEBBECKE list.

05:12.570 --> 05:19.840
And they can find my stocking list here showing all the topics related to this.

05:20.280 --> 05:28.710
So now everything is fine if I'm going to do roast topic list of what they should i should also see

05:28.710 --> 05:35.840
the same topics you can see now that we have all the topics.

05:35.840 --> 05:41.760
So if I close Russ in this machine I'm going to close roads here.

05:42.260 --> 05:46.610
If I make most of it list unable to communicate with the master.

05:46.610 --> 05:46.880
Why.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.830
Because I have closed the doors here.

05:48.860 --> 05:59.340
So if I put trust back a score from this machine I am able to find the topics.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.020
OK.

06:00.230 --> 06:03.360
Running on the Michi of the robot.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.000
If I wanted to see me again.

06:06.890 --> 06:08.930
And there on the it.

06:09.150 --> 06:18.540
So you can see that now this workstation have access to these robot machines so any code that you write

06:19.140 --> 06:26.340
in these workstation machines will be able to control all the rest nodes and the rest of peaks that

06:26.430 --> 06:29.230
are running into the machine.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.320
OK.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.360
So let's see if you make any effort into consideration.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.470
For example I'm going to close everything again.

06:37.880 --> 06:38.520
OK.

06:38.560 --> 06:47.480
And let me go to the as I see so imagine that you are not able to.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.330
You did not do that correctly.

06:49.330 --> 06:53.120
Let's see if you put the idea of the workstation.

06:53.350 --> 06:54.060
OK.

06:54.390 --> 06:56.540
Of the sheets.

06:57.470 --> 07:10.900
So now I have to close all these notes up and then again.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.420
OK so let's see what happens.

07:13.420 --> 07:17.350
Now we can't underscore here.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.140
OK.

07:19.900 --> 07:25.410
I'm able to make a stop list least no problem on the ceiling or with machine.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.930
Now even the rest of the police is OK it's not it's not raining.

07:32.930 --> 07:33.380
Why.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.430
Because because he says that the must tell you is in the same workstation.

07:37.440 --> 07:45.650
So now he doesn't refer to this sort of message if I want to fix what they should do with respect to

07:46.220 --> 07:48.490
the IP address of the machine.

07:48.930 --> 07:49.610
OK.

07:49.740 --> 07:53.010
I have to make source that I see again.

07:54.350 --> 07:58.050
To take effect so now I can see that those mustardy takes effect.

07:58.190 --> 08:04.650
And if I may cross it just so we'll able to see the same topics.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.650
And here this machine.

08:06.690 --> 08:07.960
Now I.

08:08.850 --> 08:10.200
The load.

08:10.740 --> 08:16.500
And again I would be able to see all the topics on the pitch.

08:17.030 --> 08:24.020
So to summarize when you want to continually Walkstation to control over the machine.

08:24.440 --> 08:29.520
So you have to make a configuration into both the machine and the workstation.

08:29.750 --> 08:33.870
So in the machine you have to specify the roast master.

08:34.320 --> 08:43.400
As in any local host this is the default port number and you have also explored the rows the IP of the

08:43.400 --> 08:49.880
robot machine to be equal to the IP address of the on that machine and the IP address you can get it

08:50.270 --> 08:52.910
using that if.

08:53.290 --> 08:53.920
OK.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.710
Which gives you the IP address.

08:56.720 --> 09:00.440
So exactly the same thing what you should do in the workstation.

09:00.530 --> 09:10.430
You have to find those IP and DOS hostname as the IP address of the workstation the IP address of the

09:10.570 --> 09:12.830
world.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.070
Same thing for that also.

09:15.210 --> 09:16.900
The.

09:17.930 --> 09:24.860
And then the Rassmussen you must find the remote machine of what is the robot machine.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.960
So this is the IP address of the robot.

09:27.050 --> 09:35.450
As you can see here so doing so you will be able to develop programs that run into your workstation

09:35.500 --> 09:39.460
and control the robot machine.

09:39.920 --> 09:47.750
So illustrate this are an example I'm going to run an application on the workstation machine that controls

09:47.750 --> 09:49.870
the sim on Match.

09:50.090 --> 09:55.640
So we not only across run seem to see know.

09:56.300 --> 10:02.640
So now we have to see and they want to control this using the theory of application of the C.

10:02.720 --> 10:10.550
So instead of running on the same machine I'm going to run into the workstation a C so all you need

10:10.550 --> 10:11.900
to do is to make a restaurant.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.280
So not to say that I didn't try and rescore cake.

10:16.400 --> 10:22.450
The firing squad is going to have a conflict because it is already running on one one.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.850
This is the robot machine.

10:24.920 --> 10:30.280
So you should not run us again because it's already running but you can do it.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.950
And I'm so certain up

10:37.480 --> 10:38.740
to.

10:39.580 --> 10:41.570
Totally up.

10:42.170 --> 10:47.340
Now I am in the workstation machine here.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.690
I mean this workstation machine.

10:48.750 --> 10:56.190
I'm going to press the auto keys and you to see that the now Winterton is moving.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.250
Controlling its motions on the workstation.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.770
So now we come to the end of this story.

11:02.790 --> 11:03.700
Thanks for watching.
