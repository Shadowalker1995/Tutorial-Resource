00:05.460 --> 00:08.350
Hello everyone before we actually get started with coding.

00:08.430 --> 00:09.640
Opening night gym.

00:09.740 --> 00:16.460
What I want to do is cover just a few basic setup and best practices when working with the gym library.

00:17.790 --> 00:24.040
So let's go ahead and review the best practices with open gym for working of opening night gym.

00:24.090 --> 00:29.250
I actually recommend that you use either a text editor or an integrated development environment instead

00:29.250 --> 00:30.850
of a Jupiter notebook.

00:31.140 --> 00:36.930
What we're going to be doing of that opening gym is rendering some to them mentionable drawings or environments

00:37.290 --> 00:41.000
and sometimes those renderings have issues of Jupiter notebooks.

00:41.010 --> 00:46.490
So what I recommend doing is using either a text editor such as subline text editor or Adam text editor.

00:46.530 --> 00:51.090
A simple Google search of those will just take you straight to the download page or if you want.

00:51.120 --> 00:56.730
You can use a full integrated development environment such as pi charm and or basic set up is going

00:56.730 --> 01:02.550
to be to code out the PI files or the high scripts in the editor and then execute the code at the command

01:02.550 --> 01:03.100
line.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.100
There are many possible plug ins for subline Texan Adam text editor that alive.

01:08.120 --> 01:15.110
Also have the command line or the terminal directly inside those text editors open AI.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.590
Thus again technically work in the Jupiter notebook but sometimes the pending on your operating system

01:19.650 --> 01:25.740
running multiple renderings of an environment can lead to freezing or just very slow behavior of the

01:25.740 --> 01:26.410
gym.

01:26.490 --> 01:30.900
So it always works when we run up Paice groups so that's what we're going to be using for this course.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.550
That way in case you're using another operating system you don't get hung up on any errors but you can

01:35.550 --> 01:39.810
if you want attempt to first off use cheaper notebooks.

01:39.820 --> 01:43.050
OK so we're going to do right now is quickly check the opening.

01:43.070 --> 01:48.730
Jim is installed and also show you how to run a PI script as well as going through how you would download

01:48.730 --> 01:50.420
a text editor if you need it.

01:50.620 --> 01:56.020
And I want a quick note here please feel free to use any either text editor or development environment

01:56.020 --> 01:58.630
configuration you prefer.

01:58.650 --> 02:01.290
So we're going to be using atom for this series of lectures.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.320
It's a open source free text editor from hub.

02:04.440 --> 02:09.770
And remember you have many options including just ticking of Jupiter notebooks in case you prefer that.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.970
So right now we're going to open up our browser and go to Adam.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.460
Let's hop over to that.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.530
OK so here we are.

02:16.540 --> 02:20.470
Adam Oh Adam is just a basic text editor.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.870
It's open source and it's free is provided from get hub and depending on what operating system you're

02:25.870 --> 02:28.210
using you should see a download button here.

02:28.210 --> 02:32.210
If you're on Windows you see the windows installer if you're on a Mac you should see the Mac installer.

02:32.350 --> 02:37.660
And if you're on Linux or Bluetooth should see some sort of download of either S.H. file or some sort

02:37.660 --> 02:38.950
of installation file.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.420
So go ahead and click on that and install the Adam text editor.

02:42.430 --> 02:47.350
It's a basic text editor and it's going to provide us things with syntax highlighting for that py files

02:47.730 --> 02:48.320
etc..

02:48.340 --> 02:51.740
So go ahead and download that and then I've already downloaded it.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.270
Open it up on my computer.

02:53.350 --> 02:54.810
Let's jump to that now.

02:54.820 --> 02:58.440
All right so once you open up Adam the first time it should look something like this.

02:58.450 --> 03:03.220
Well we're going to do teach you one last thing which is how to install a terminal package.

03:03.220 --> 03:07.600
That way you don't have to keep jumping back to either command prompt or terminal but instead you can

03:07.600 --> 03:10.480
have a terminal directly in the Adam text editor.

03:10.510 --> 03:12.180
This is optional you don't need to do this.

03:12.220 --> 03:17.170
You could always just open up your terminal command line separately and run up high script from there.

03:17.350 --> 03:21.940
But let me also show you how the general insulation package works and that them click here where it

03:21.940 --> 03:28.240
says install a package and then say open installer and that will open up this page and then you search

03:28.240 --> 03:29.100
packages.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.930
So you're going to search for terminal and then hit enter and then it will say the featured packages

03:34.960 --> 03:39.700
and it's going to say searching in packages for terminal and eventually you should see in this dropdown

03:39.700 --> 03:43.200
list the platform you dash the terminal.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.340
And this is the package that allows you to have basically a little plus sign that open up a command

03:48.340 --> 03:50.410
line directly in the Adam text editor.

03:50.620 --> 03:54.480
So I already have it installed but you should see a little Install button there.

03:54.610 --> 03:58.520
If you can't find that just by searching terminal go out and search the entire name platform you know

03:58.530 --> 04:03.250
dash ID dash terminal install it and if you ever want to mess around with the settings you can do is

04:03.250 --> 04:08.740
click here in settings and this will take you to the platform your ID settings and as you scroll down

04:08.740 --> 04:14.530
here what I recommend you do if you're on a Windows computer is to override the shell sometimes by default.

04:14.530 --> 04:15.910
It uses power shell.

04:15.910 --> 04:21.370
You can go ahead and copy and paste this line right here in and send it to your Siham the executable

04:21.370 --> 04:22.150
file.

04:22.150 --> 04:23.680
That way it launches the command prompt.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.590
It's sort of the power shell.

04:25.660 --> 04:30.340
Once you've done this you may need to restart items to go ahead and close out them again and open it

04:30.340 --> 04:30.910
up.

04:30.910 --> 04:35.230
Once you've done that you should see at the very bottom a little plus sign you can click on that plus

04:35.230 --> 04:38.020
sign and that opens up a new terminal for you.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.660
And here you can run things such as straight python from the command line so you can get Python and

04:42.670 --> 04:45.810
they have this little terminal in your text editor.

04:45.880 --> 04:51.310
So let's go ahead and quit this and let's practice and make sure that we have Jim installed onto our

04:51.310 --> 04:52.170
computer.

04:52.180 --> 04:58.610
So where are you going to do is you're going to activate C-f deep learning environment.

04:58.610 --> 04:59.610
We've been using.

04:59.820 --> 05:03.950
And Jim should already be installed in T.F. deep learning.

05:04.050 --> 05:09.060
But just in case it isn't you can use Pipp install Jim enter.

05:09.260 --> 05:13.970
And you should see it installed Lotusphere already get the requirement already satisfied because they

05:13.980 --> 05:15.360
already have gym installed.

05:15.380 --> 05:18.450
Once you've done that you can go ahead and run a thought PI script.

05:18.650 --> 05:22.380
In this TFT planning environment let's review how to do that.

05:22.490 --> 05:29.120
So we're going to just say file will save new file and this will open up a new file here and we're just

05:29.120 --> 05:34.970
going to say import Jim and then we'll print out.

05:35.050 --> 05:37.090
It works right now.

05:37.100 --> 05:42.680
There's no syntax highlighting because I haven't actually named this or save this so I'll say file or

05:42.680 --> 05:46.150
list control SLB easier just control as or commands.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.380
And then you can save this wherever you want.

05:48.430 --> 05:53.290
So since I'm under C users Marsat right now I will save it there.

05:53.350 --> 05:58.410
So I've moved over to that directory and then I'm just going to call it my test.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.720
Jim py file.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.850
Hit save and notice once becomes a PI file.

06:04.900 --> 06:09.280
What's going to happen is it's going to automatically open up all the folders there and your project

06:09.280 --> 06:09.870
folder.

06:09.990 --> 06:14.130
And it's also going to import that syntax highlighting which is nice and useful for us.

06:14.170 --> 06:17.350
So then what we can do here is Bechet this command line.

06:17.350 --> 06:20.650
Just type in Python and then begin to type in the name.

06:20.650 --> 06:21.590
My test.

06:21.610 --> 06:27.150
Jim you can just do tabbed to autocomplete there enter and you should see eventually it works.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.750
Hopefully you don't get any error that says Jim not found if you're getting an error saying Jim not

06:31.750 --> 06:38.590
found then triple check that you've activated your learning environment and that you also installed

06:38.650 --> 06:40.830
Jim using pipin Solanum.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.240
OK.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.920
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

06:43.960 --> 06:49.360
Again you pretty much have total flexibility as far as what kind of method you want to use for running

06:49.390 --> 06:51.000
these dot scripts for Jim.

06:51.010 --> 06:55.420
You can use the Jupiter notebook but if you ever get into bugs then I recommend that you download that

06:55.420 --> 06:59.680
you print a book as it by script and then just run that PI script at your command line.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.400
So if you really use the Jupiter book you could technically keep using that as well.

07:03.400 --> 07:08.110
You actually don't need to switch to a text editor but I'm going to be using a text editor here just

07:08.110 --> 07:13.390
to make sure that everyone no matter what their O S here can follow along with me with no bugs or no

07:13.390 --> 07:16.310
errors when rendering their gym environments.

07:16.330 --> 07:18.250
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
