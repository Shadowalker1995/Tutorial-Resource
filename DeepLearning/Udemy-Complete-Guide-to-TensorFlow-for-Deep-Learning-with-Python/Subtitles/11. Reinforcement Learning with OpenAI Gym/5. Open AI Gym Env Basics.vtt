00:05.360 --> 00:07.190
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

00:07.190 --> 00:13.530
We're going to discuss just the very basics of creating in an environment with opening gym library.

00:13.570 --> 00:16.230
So we're going to explore how to create the carpool environment.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.070
One of the most basic environments that comes of opening a gym and it also doesn't require any additional

00:21.070 --> 00:22.730
libraries to be installed.

00:22.750 --> 00:26.770
So let's discuss what the actual carpool problem is.

00:26.770 --> 00:31.810
So the goal of this carpooling environment is to balance the pull on the cart and the car can move left

00:31.870 --> 00:37.650
or right and you can imagine as the cart moves around the pole will end up sliding down.

00:38.380 --> 00:44.320
So we have actions available to us in order to move the cart either left or right in an attempt to balance

00:44.320 --> 00:44.880
the pull.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.990
Well actually Theale actions in this lecture that will deal in a future lecture.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.660
But right now just keep in mind that we're going to be able to enter one of two actions either zero

00:53.680 --> 00:55.760
for left or one for right.

00:55.780 --> 01:02.140
So we're going to move that car left to right to try to keep it up pull balance as far as the environment

01:02.140 --> 01:02.910
is concerned.

01:02.950 --> 01:06.040
It's actually going to be represented with a pie array.

01:06.070 --> 01:11.380
So even though the opening I Chim library comes a nice rendering tool so you can visualize all of this

01:11.710 --> 01:13.740
as far as your actual model is concerned.

01:13.780 --> 01:19.510
It's just going to receive back a number higher rate for floating point numbers and those floating point

01:19.510 --> 01:22.250
numbers will indicate the horizontal position.

01:22.420 --> 01:26.270
So there's some initial position of the cart which we mark at zero.

01:26.470 --> 01:30.350
And then the horizontal position can be either to the left of that initial mark.

01:30.370 --> 01:33.110
So that would be some negative number or to the right of it.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.290
So we have that first horizontal position.

01:35.290 --> 01:37.490
Then we also have the horizontal velocity.

01:37.660 --> 01:41.090
So that's how fast the actual cart is moving left or right.

01:41.110 --> 01:46.240
Then we also know the angle of the pole itself as well as the angular velocity of the pole as it tends

01:46.240 --> 01:47.110
to fall down.

01:48.340 --> 01:55.010
So we can grab these values from the environment that umpire and then we'll use them for our agent right

01:55.010 --> 01:58.190
now let's just focus on the very basics of creating this environment.

01:58.250 --> 02:03.710
So I will open up my editor or open up whatever IP you're using to create your PI scripts and follow

02:03.710 --> 02:05.060
along with me.

02:05.060 --> 02:06.360
Let's go to the editor now.

02:06.620 --> 02:12.830
OK so right here we have a PI script files called my test Jim and the first thing we need to do is actually

02:12.890 --> 02:14.030
import Jim.

02:14.060 --> 02:16.750
So I will say import Jim and we'll just do that.

02:16.910 --> 02:22.190
And now it's time to actually create or make the environment that we create or make an environment is

02:22.190 --> 02:25.270
create some sort of environmental variable we'll say envy.

02:25.490 --> 02:28.370
And you can ignore this kind of drop down right here.

02:28.370 --> 02:32.990
It's just basic drop down help for Python but it's not necessary here.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.660
There we're going to call Jim.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.430
Well called the make method off the gym.

02:37.490 --> 02:43.280
So you say Jim thought make and then the passing some string code for the environment some environments

02:43.310 --> 02:48.890
as I've mentioned before have dependencies such as the Atari game environments require the Atari emulator.

02:48.890 --> 02:54.080
But in this case we're going to be using the environment that doesn't require anything to keep things

02:54.080 --> 02:58.180
simple and it will be just cart pole dash vs zero.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.360
And if you want more string codes you can always just check out the documentation.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.750
So you click on the environments page that we saw earlier and then choose any string you want.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.500
If you get an error it's probably because you needed the pendency.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.760
So go ahead and look up on the documentation what dependencies need to install.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.780
So once you've made the environment what we wanted to do is reset the environment to its default starting

03:17.780 --> 03:18.560
stage.

03:18.650 --> 03:22.010
In our case the shifts that the car is at the Zero location.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.290
So we say reset.

03:24.590 --> 03:27.170
Open and close print sees on the environment.

03:28.230 --> 03:33.660
And then what you can do is you can render the environment over several times steps she can say something

03:33.660 --> 03:37.590
like for tea in range 1000.

03:37.590 --> 03:44.280
So for some 1000 times steps we're going to do is we're going to render the environment and rendering

03:44.280 --> 03:48.740
the environment basically creates this little pop up that allows you to view the environment.

03:48.930 --> 03:51.920
And then what we're going to do here is we're going to do the following.

03:51.930 --> 03:56.210
The worry about this line of code is something we're going to talk about a lot more in the next lecture.

03:56.220 --> 04:03.120
But essentially what I'm going to do is I'm going to call the action space office environment and then

04:03.120 --> 04:06.460
I'm going to call a sample open and close princes.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.470
And what this line does the Slide 11.

04:08.580 --> 04:13.740
It's basically saying take some sort of random action from the action space from the actions available

04:13.740 --> 04:16.440
to us were either 0 or 1 left or right.

04:16.470 --> 04:22.360
What this is going to do is going to randomly sample that and then provide that step into the environment.

04:22.380 --> 04:27.610
So we shouldn't actually see the pull balance we should eventually just see some sort of random sliding.

04:27.670 --> 04:31.280
And what should happen is that slides off the actual page.

04:31.350 --> 04:36.460
So let's save this and run this so we'll say Python.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.400
My test Jim that pi.

04:38.430 --> 04:43.080
Just have to complete that and make sure that you're running this with your environment activated or

04:43.090 --> 04:44.190
they gym installed.

04:44.190 --> 04:48.930
Otherwise we're going to err enter to run this and eventually should see a little pop up there and you

04:48.930 --> 04:51.040
should see it swing off the page.

04:51.360 --> 04:51.790
OK.

04:51.870 --> 04:53.790
So that's all we have to do.

04:53.790 --> 04:59.180
Again the lines here that really focus on is you make your environment with some sort of street code.

04:59.190 --> 05:03.450
Again the string codes available to you and the documentation reset the environment to the starting

05:03.900 --> 05:08.460
position and then for a certain number of time steps you can render the environment which is what we

05:08.460 --> 05:09.150
just saw.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.600
And then you can't perform an read off that environment.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.290
So we're going to focus on next as a quick note.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.230
It really doesn't matter what you call this temporary variable because we don't actually use it inside

05:19.230 --> 05:20.300
this for loop.

05:20.430 --> 05:25.260
So it's common to just have an underscore here because underscores are typically kind of throw away

05:25.260 --> 05:30.060
variables stuff you don't really end up using inside your for loops so just keep that in mind if you

05:30.060 --> 05:30.900
ever see this.

05:31.170 --> 05:33.300
It's really come just these underscore there.

05:33.630 --> 05:34.730
All right thanks everyone.

05:34.730 --> 05:39.120
And the next lecture we're going to focus on being able to take actions and reading the environment

05:39.590 --> 05:40.450
I'll see it there.
