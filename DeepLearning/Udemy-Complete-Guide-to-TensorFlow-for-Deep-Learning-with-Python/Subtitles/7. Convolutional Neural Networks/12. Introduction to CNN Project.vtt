00:05.290 --> 00:09.520
Hello everyone and welcome to your exercise for this section of the course where you're going to be

00:09.520 --> 00:15.520
using convolutional neural networks to classify the famous see far 10 dataset.

00:15.550 --> 00:22.110
So this is an optional exercise to see far 10 data set to see a certain data set consists of sixty thousand

00:22.130 --> 00:29.830
32 by 32 color images in 10 classes with 6000 images per class where there are 50000 training images

00:29.920 --> 00:34.210
and 10000 test images to make a total of 60000 images.

00:34.210 --> 00:39.040
Now the reason this is optional is because it is actually quite challenging especially given what we

00:39.040 --> 00:43.630
know so far about convolutional neural networks and the main challenge is actually dealing with the

00:43.630 --> 00:50.050
data and creating tensor batches and making sure everything has the right dimensions and size actually

00:50.050 --> 00:53.580
creating that convolutional layers and creating the pulling layers.

00:53.590 --> 00:56.050
Given what we've already covered is pretty straightforward.

00:56.050 --> 00:59.570
In fact it's almost the exact same process as what we've just heard before.

00:59.740 --> 01:01.930
And you can actually vary some of the parameters.

01:01.930 --> 01:09.490
The real hard part is getting this data as an image and then creating that next batch function or actually

01:09.490 --> 01:10.600
sizing it correctly.

01:10.630 --> 01:15.440
Because remember with the data set all of that was taken care of for us under the hood.

01:15.640 --> 01:20.200
When you're dealing with real data sets your own images or images that don't have these convenience

01:20.200 --> 01:24.660
functions you're going to spend a lot of time actually creating those convenience functions.

01:24.730 --> 01:29.650
And in the exercise notebook a lot of that's already been pre-filled out for you because it is a quite

01:29.650 --> 01:32.020
challenging and time consuming.

01:32.020 --> 01:35.950
So we're going to go through the exercise notebook and then you can decide whether or not you feel like

01:35.950 --> 01:41.080
just treating this as a code along lecturer so you'll skip to the solutions lecture and code along or

01:41.080 --> 01:45.640
feeling a little more ambitious just try your best and see how far you can get on your own through the

01:45.640 --> 01:47.020
exercise notebook.

01:47.020 --> 01:51.560
So let's open up that exercise notebook and show you where you can find the data.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.750
Ok so here I am under the convolutional neural networks folder.

01:54.860 --> 01:59.480
You should notice that there is a CNN project exercise notebook file go ahead and click on that one

01:59.900 --> 02:03.890
and you'll also notice that there's a folder here called See four batches dash pi.

02:03.950 --> 02:08.150
That's where the actual data is contain and it comes in five little batches here.

02:08.150 --> 02:13.520
So keep that in mind and when you open up the exercise notebook you'll notice that there is a description

02:13.520 --> 02:14.810
of what you're going to end up doing.

02:14.810 --> 02:20.210
You're essentially going to be classifying between 10 classes or color images and you're going to follow

02:20.210 --> 02:22.650
along with the instructions in bold.

02:22.700 --> 02:29.150
Now step 0 called get the data actually already has all of this essentially filled out for you.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.750
So you're going to load the data and you're going to use the code here.

02:31.850 --> 02:34.210
That's already been made for you.

02:34.370 --> 02:40.160
And the reason for this is it is really time consuming process and you're basically going to have to

02:40.220 --> 02:45.020
manually convert these images and create these next batch convenience functions.

02:45.020 --> 02:49.370
And because that's really time consuming and it doesn't actually have a lot to do of convolutional neural

02:49.370 --> 02:53.120
networks it's more just kind of the dirty work of working in a python.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.900
It's already been filled out for you so you can focus on learning about convolutional neural networks.

02:57.950 --> 03:02.750
So if you scroll down here there's a lot of explanation about the data how it's formatted.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.720
So there's tons of text.

03:03.730 --> 03:07.850
You're free to read through then displaying a single image using that plot lib.

03:07.850 --> 03:14.720
There's also little examples of showing that so there's some code here that says you need to fill this

03:14.720 --> 03:15.010
out.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.170
Put the code here that transforms the X array etc..

03:18.260 --> 03:23.300
And once you're done kind of dealing with the data there is a little helper functions here such as the

03:23.300 --> 03:24.430
one high end coding.

03:24.480 --> 03:29.390
Then there's also a class that I made for you to set up the images of training setting them up and then

03:29.390 --> 03:30.850
grabbing that next batch.

03:30.850 --> 03:34.770
And it shows you how you can use the above code then you'll get to the create model.

03:34.820 --> 03:38.130
And that's where you end up having a bunch of empty cells free to fill out.

03:38.210 --> 03:43.220
And then she wants you to recreate those helper functions that we did earlier basically going to look

03:43.220 --> 03:46.260
really similar to the ones we did in the dataset.

03:46.300 --> 03:50.630
And if you want you can just kind of copy and paste if you forget what they look like then you'll create

03:50.630 --> 03:51.610
the layers again.

03:51.650 --> 03:55.040
And there's hints here on what shapes and what sizes to use.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.170
So you can scroll down loss function optimizer graph session etc..

03:59.180 --> 04:02.020
Now keep in mind this is going to take a long time to run.

04:02.030 --> 04:08.090
I have a really fast computer so I ran it for let's see River 5000 steps and got 17 percent accuracy.

04:08.210 --> 04:14.780
So we should kind of aim for around that and again kind of the whole half our first half of dealing

04:14.780 --> 04:15.650
with the data.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.800
It's been technically fill that for you.

04:17.810 --> 04:23.060
But what I really want you to do is if you try to do this as an exercise go line by line and make sure

04:23.060 --> 04:26.520
you understand a lot of this code actually that even write it.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.840
It comes with the data set itself.

04:28.850 --> 04:34.010
So for instance is an pickling function that actually if you go to the link of where to download the

04:34.010 --> 04:34.790
data.

04:34.820 --> 04:40.530
So if you come over here to download data and click on this link they'll take you to the data source

04:40.940 --> 04:45.700
and then if you scroll down here the providers of the data actually kind of have instructions here of

04:45.710 --> 04:48.610
how to open the data and pickle it etc..

04:48.620 --> 04:51.880
So this is actually the code that's directly here in the notebook.

04:51.890 --> 04:56.360
So if you're an independent researcher and trying to work this data you would've already had this code

04:56.360 --> 04:57.980
available for you anyways.

04:57.980 --> 05:02.000
And this is just kind of some convenience functions to working the code.

05:02.000 --> 05:02.620
OK.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.840
So take your time with this project.

05:05.840 --> 05:11.000
It's a it's pretty challenging to be perfectly honest as it should be convolutional neural networks

05:11.360 --> 05:13.330
are not the easiest thing in the world.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.120
So take your time with this see how far you can get.

05:16.140 --> 05:22.100
Again if you're going to do it as an exercise please make sure to read and go step by step through what

05:22.100 --> 05:28.320
is the step zero of getting the data before you jump forward to actually creating the network.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.110
So all of these cells need to be run.

05:30.140 --> 05:34.840
You should be understanding every line as part of the exercise and will be going through that throughout

05:34.850 --> 05:37.620
the solutions before you actually end up creating the model.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.470
So don't just skip to create the model.

05:39.530 --> 05:41.670
Make sure you understand all the code before it.

05:42.050 --> 05:42.510
All right.

05:42.770 --> 05:47.420
So coming up next we're gonna have a series of lectures going through this project and treating it as

05:47.420 --> 05:48.950
a code along solution.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.830
Again it's optional it's up to you whether you want to treat it as a code along.

05:51.830 --> 05:55.910
If you ever get stuck during the exercise please check over to the solutions video where we'll have

05:55.910 --> 05:58.360
full explanations for all the steps.

05:58.370 --> 06:00.320
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
