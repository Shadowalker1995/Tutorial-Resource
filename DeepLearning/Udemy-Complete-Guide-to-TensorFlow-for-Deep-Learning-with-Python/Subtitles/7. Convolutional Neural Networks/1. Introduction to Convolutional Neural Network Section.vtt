Welcome everyone to this section on convolutional neural networks in this section we're going to be

00:11.270 --> 00:12.670
covering several things.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.780
We'll start off with a quick review of previous topics and neural networks then we'll discuss some new

00:17.780 --> 00:22.030
theory topics that will help set up your learning for convolutional neural networks.

00:22.070 --> 00:25.840
We'll also discuss the famous EMIs handwritten digits dataset.

00:25.900 --> 00:32.030
Then we're going to solve the classification problem of this with a quote unquote normal neural network

00:32.030 --> 00:32.840
set up.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.100
We're going to learn about the theory behind that convolutional neural network and then we'll revisit

00:37.100 --> 00:38.690
the problem and solve it.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.280
Convolutional neural nets.

00:40.430 --> 00:45.550
After that they'll have the convolutional neural network exercise and the solutions afterwards.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.070
All right let's get started.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.110
I'll see you at the next lecture.
