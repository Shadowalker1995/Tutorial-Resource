Welcome everyone the tensor flow basics section of the course so I've already had a crash course on

00:11.640 --> 00:14.180
the very basic libraries that we use of Python.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.040
And then we've already covered a very basic introduction to neural networks.

00:18.060 --> 00:23.160
Now it's time to use this section of the course to expand what have already learned and begin to actually

00:23.160 --> 00:26.820
explore tensor Flo's framework approach to neural networks.

00:26.940 --> 00:31.950
And hopefully you're going to be seeing lots of parallels with our own simple implementation that we

00:31.950 --> 00:34.910
performed in the previous section.

00:35.150 --> 00:38.090
So let's cover what this section is actually going to do.

00:38.090 --> 00:42.470
We're first going to start off with just going over the basic syntax for tensor flow and then we'll

00:42.470 --> 00:45.650
discuss tensor flow graphs variables and placeholders.

00:45.650 --> 00:49.730
And those are all going to feel very familiar based of what we've already covered.

00:49.730 --> 00:55.640
Then we'll actually implement a tensor float neural network then we'll continue showing some simple

00:55.640 --> 01:01.700
examples of using tensor flow for a regression task member that's supervised learning as well as a classification

01:01.700 --> 01:02.060
task.

01:02.060 --> 01:05.880
So we have to code along lectures one for aggression one for classification.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.430
Then to make sure you feel comfortable all the topics we've covered in the section we'll finish it off

01:10.430 --> 01:16.340
with two exercises a regression task exercise and then a corresponding solution lecture as well as a

01:16.340 --> 01:17.950
classification exercise.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.240
And again a solution lecture for that.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.180
OK let's get started.

01:22.190 --> 01:25.720
I'll see you at the next lecture where we began the basic syntax of tensor flow.
