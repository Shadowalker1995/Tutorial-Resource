Welcome everyone to an introduction to neural networks in this section of the course we're going to

00:10.820 --> 00:16.370
have a series of lectures that will cover key theoretical topics and aspects surrounding the neural

00:16.370 --> 00:22.700
network model that is things like neurons percept trons activation functions as well as cost functions.

00:22.700 --> 00:29.680
Gradient descent and back propagation once we build a general very high level understanding we're going

00:29.680 --> 00:35.220
to code out all of these topics manually with Python without the use of a deep learning library.

00:35.230 --> 00:41.400
Basically we're actually going to try to do is manually create a very simple version of tensor flow.

00:41.410 --> 00:46.560
Once you've actually built this by hand manually with Python we're going to move on to using the deep

00:46.690 --> 00:52.840
library for this course tensor flow understanding a high level overview of these key elements is really

00:52.840 --> 00:55.350
going to make it much easier to understand what's happening.

00:55.390 --> 01:02.700
Once we begin to use tensor flow and tensor flow has direct connections to these concepts in its syntax.

01:02.710 --> 01:04.180
All right let's get started.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.520
I'll see you at the next lecture.
