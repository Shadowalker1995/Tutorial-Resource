00:05.420 --> 00:06.520
Welcome back everyone.

00:06.530 --> 00:12.110
The course installation and setup lecture in this lecture will be showing you how to download Anaconda

00:12.530 --> 00:16.730
how to restore the environment file that's included with the zip download for this course and then a

00:16.730 --> 00:20.020
quick overview of Jupiter in case you haven't used that before.

00:20.180 --> 00:22.510
Let's go to our browser and go to Anaconda.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.740
Com slash download.

00:24.910 --> 00:26.070
OK so here's the.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.620
Anaconda dot com slash download.

00:28.780 --> 00:34.600
And keep in mind sometimes Anaconda changes the look or styling of the site but the content should be

00:34.600 --> 00:35.420
the same.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.010
It's where you can download the Anaconda distribution.

00:38.080 --> 00:44.280
The distribution is just a high performance distribution of a lot of data science packages for Python.

00:44.290 --> 00:48.770
It's extremely popular in the data science space which is why we're going to be using it here.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.650
So the first thing we need to do is actually download the Anaconda distribution and it comes for the

00:53.650 --> 00:59.710
Windows Mac OS or Linux or a boon to systems and windows a Mac OS pretty straightforward.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.260
You just click on whatever your operating system is and then download and then it's going to be a graphical

01:05.260 --> 01:05.990
installer.

01:06.010 --> 01:09.580
Basically just follow the steps that it says on the graphical installer.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.000
The Mac OS is essentially the same deal.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.150
Graphical installer click download and then follow the steps.

01:15.260 --> 01:20.050
Linux if you click on that link it's going to be an installer for you which you'll have to download

01:20.410 --> 01:22.140
and run at the command line.

01:22.150 --> 01:26.230
So again you ever get stuck on either Windows Mac or us or Linux.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.570
There's a really nice helpful links here that says how to install Anaconda.

01:29.770 --> 01:35.490
You can go ahead and click on that and if you run Linux it will take you to direct commands for Linux.

01:35.620 --> 01:41.440
So essentially you just in your browser download Yianna installer for Linux and then 2 is optional so

01:41.440 --> 01:47.230
you can basically skip that and then three is the following to install an account for her Python 3.6.

01:47.230 --> 01:53.320
So basically you just say bash and then wherever the location is of that SH file that you just downloaded

01:53.320 --> 01:54.430
from Anaconda.

01:54.570 --> 01:58.710
They can continue on the rest of these steps so that is for Linux.

01:58.750 --> 02:03.490
If you come over here where it says installation it will then take you to the more detailed information

02:03.790 --> 02:05.340
for Windows and Mac OS users.

02:05.350 --> 02:10.150
You can click here on Windows and they'll say the Nikon installer and you can basically follow along

02:10.150 --> 02:10.900
here.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.500
Now there is a quick notes.

02:12.550 --> 02:19.510
I want to make about installing with anaconda to your path variable to Lotus here.

02:19.540 --> 02:25.090
One of the very first things you do as you're installing is to decide whether you want to add anaconda

02:25.150 --> 02:30.940
to your path environment variable and Akala themselves recommend that you don't do this because it can

02:30.940 --> 02:34.600
interfere with prior distributions of Python in your computer.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.170
We're going to assume that if your Delanie anaconda you want this to be your main distribution of Python.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.610
So make sure you click to add anaconda to your path environment variable.

02:43.670 --> 02:44.980
That's a really important step.

02:45.070 --> 02:50.230
If you don't end up clicking that what's going to happen is you have to add the PAF manually and if

02:50.230 --> 02:51.390
you want you can do that as well.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.080
But you might as well do it since the beginning.

02:53.260 --> 02:57.830
So again to make sure you click on this word says add anaconda to my path environment variable.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.400
Even though it says not recommended we recommend that for this course.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.160
All right so that's it.

03:03.160 --> 03:08.410
Go ahead and install Anaconda and then we'll show you how you can restore the environment file.

03:08.410 --> 03:12.310
Let's jump back to our desktop.

03:12.320 --> 03:17.540
OK so by now you should have downloaded installed Anaconda onto your computer so it's time to restore

03:17.540 --> 03:19.130
the environment file.

03:19.130 --> 03:23.660
Remember that you should have downloaded the zip file by now from either the fakey lecture or the Course

03:23.720 --> 03:25.610
overview lecture if you haven't done so.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.760
Go back and view the course overview lecture.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.600
Download the zip file that's a resource there and then unzip it somewhere on your computer.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.770
Then the next step if you're a Mac OS or Linux.

03:34.790 --> 03:39.050
Open up your terminal so that you can just do a search for terminal in your computer and you should

03:39.050 --> 03:39.770
find it.

03:39.860 --> 03:43.820
If you're a Windows user go ahead and open up the command prompt or CNID.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.260
In other alternative is to open up the Anaconda prompt and that's especially useful if in case you ever

03:48.260 --> 03:53.000
get errors like Konda not recognized as you go throughout this installation process.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.210
So again Windows users either use CMD.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.720
Or if that's giving you trouble.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.690
Use the Anaconda prompt again just search your computer for it or so once you're in your terminal or

04:02.690 --> 04:08.510
command line where you're going to do is use CD to change directory to where ever the unzips course

04:08.510 --> 04:09.500
notes are.

04:09.620 --> 04:16.100
Then you're going to run the following command Kano's space Ian EMV space create space dash f space

04:16.450 --> 04:19.550
FDL underscore Ian V Y and L.

04:19.790 --> 04:24.110
So that's going to then use the environment file that's provided for you and create an environment that

04:24.110 --> 04:28.140
we're using all the same versions of all the libraries we use while making this course.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.130
Once you've created the environment file you can that activate it.

04:32.130 --> 04:34.810
If you're on a Mac OS or Linux you're going to use source.

04:34.860 --> 04:38.050
Activate T.F. deep learning that's the name of the environment.

04:38.130 --> 04:42.100
If you're on a Windows computer then you're going to use just activate T.F. deep learning.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.510
Ok so I'm going to actually walk through these steps on a computer.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.880
So let's hop over to my command line.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.820
OK so real quick I want to make the note again.

04:50.860 --> 04:55.990
You should have already unzipped the tensor flow bootcamp file that zip file that comes from the resource

04:55.990 --> 04:58.090
notes and have something that looks like this.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.200
You'll see a bunch of folders.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.670
If you click on one of these folders you'll notice that there's these IPY in the files so there's the

05:03.670 --> 05:05.810
notebook files we'll be using throughout the course.

05:05.810 --> 05:11.410
So again here you can see the IPY and B files and then also you'll sometimes see some data files.

05:11.410 --> 05:15.110
So the other important thing to note is that you have the dot y m l file.

05:15.250 --> 05:18.690
That's going to be the environment file that we'll be using for this course.

05:18.820 --> 05:23.710
So we need to somehow get to this tensor flow bootcamp in order to do that we'll come over to our command

05:23.710 --> 05:25.060
prompt.

05:25.060 --> 05:27.250
So here I am now at my command prompt.

05:27.430 --> 05:31.590
So all we're gonna do is use CD to get there.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.810
Notice that I'm actually already here.

05:33.970 --> 05:40.520
So in case you need to move around you can you see the dot dot and that will go back up a directory.

05:40.540 --> 05:46.180
So if I did it again I would say CD that thought and now that my user directory if I need to go into

05:46.180 --> 05:51.700
a directory I just say CD and then begin to type the directory's name and you should be able to then

05:51.700 --> 05:56.030
tab autocomplete and it will auto complete the next directory over.

05:56.260 --> 06:01.930
So then this has changed directory into the data courses and then it can change directory again into

06:02.130 --> 06:03.240
tents or float bootcamp.

06:03.250 --> 06:09.190
So again see the dot to go back up 1 and then see the dot and then her CD and then whatever the name

06:09.220 --> 06:11.530
of your directory is to get there.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.890
Once you're actually located in the tents flow bootcamp folder.

06:14.890 --> 06:17.620
It's time to create the environment file.

06:17.770 --> 06:22.450
So you're going to run the line you're going to say Konda space into the space.

06:22.600 --> 06:29.230
Create dash F and then you'll say T.F. DL underscore E and V.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.810
Y M L.

06:30.910 --> 06:35.680
So this is basically telling conver to create this environment file and to double check that you're

06:35.710 --> 06:37.160
in the correct directory.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.490
You should be able to.

06:38.500 --> 06:44.200
Once you start typing T.F. d hit tab and it should autocomplete for you.

06:44.210 --> 06:48.490
If this is if it does not autocomplete that's probably an indicator that you're not in the right directory

06:48.940 --> 06:50.590
so go ahead and then run this line.

06:50.590 --> 06:54.340
Can the environment create FDL environment that why m-L.

06:54.460 --> 06:55.790
So I've already run that.

06:56.050 --> 07:00.340
Once you've done that and you've created the file it should be kind of a bunch of pop ups asking you

07:00.340 --> 07:02.660
to create stuff or install stuff.

07:02.710 --> 07:06.350
You may need to click y on your keyboard to give it permission to do stuff.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.710
The next step is to actually activate the environment so that should have created an environment called

07:11.050 --> 07:12.370
deep learning.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.720
So then you're going to say activates or remember if you're a Mac or Linux you'll see source activate

07:17.890 --> 07:26.710
T.F. deep learning enter and then you'll eventually see the falling imprint you'll see TFT learning

07:27.070 --> 07:32.140
that's basically indicating that right now you're in this virtual environment of TFT learning if you

07:32.140 --> 07:34.250
ever want to escape out of this environment.

07:34.270 --> 07:42.780
You'll just say de-activate deactivates actually you just need to say de-activate.

07:42.990 --> 07:44.070
There you go.

07:44.070 --> 07:49.680
So again if you want to go into the virtual environment you'll say activate the learning or activate

07:49.680 --> 07:50.780
TFT learning.

07:51.300 --> 07:55.250
If you're on a Mac or Linux you'll see a source activate or source deactivate.

07:55.620 --> 08:00.700
OK once you've done that what you're going to do is type Jupiter notebook and hit enter.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.630
This should automatically open up a browser for you.

08:03.660 --> 08:08.760
If it does not go ahead and copy this you are along with the token link if especially if it's your first

08:08.760 --> 08:10.160
time ever using Jupiter.

08:10.410 --> 08:14.070
So if you don't see your browser automatically pop up there should be a nice link here.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.140
They can just copy and paste into your browser.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.170
And remember to copy along with that token.

08:18.450 --> 08:18.710
OK.

08:18.730 --> 08:21.110
Let's hop over to the browser.

08:21.190 --> 08:25.250
OK so your browser should look something like this in order to start a new notebook.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.850
We're going to end up doing is say new.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.690
And then underneath notebook you'll see Python 3 go ahead and click on it.

08:30.700 --> 08:34.650
This may say something like Can the router default it should say Python 3.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.560
But whatever is underneath this notebook.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.500
Go ahead and click on it.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.750
So here I have Python 3.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.530
And then we're going to make sure that everything's working for you.

08:42.700 --> 08:49.960
So we'll say import tents or flow as T.F. do shift enter to run a cell that you put Jupiter notebook

08:49.960 --> 08:57.380
system uses cells and then we'll say hello is equal to T.F..

08:57.410 --> 09:06.520
Constance you'll type the the string hello world do shift enter there and then you'll say S E S S is

09:06.520 --> 09:11.830
equal to T.F. session and the way we'll will go over this code a lot more detail in the future.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.200
This is just the check that senseful is working for you.

09:14.440 --> 09:21.330
And then you're going to do the following you'll say Prince as Iesous that run an imprint c.s.

09:21.390 --> 09:22.240
Hello.

09:22.990 --> 09:27.850
So just passing in that hello variable you made do shift and try to run this you should get out a string

09:27.850 --> 09:29.740
that says Hello world.

09:29.740 --> 09:34.970
And that shows you successfully ran tensor flow on your computer and you are all ready to go.

09:35.350 --> 09:35.780
OK.

09:35.830 --> 09:36.820
So that's it.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.260
If you already know how to use Jupiter you can go ahead and skip to the next lecture just now for one

09:41.260 --> 09:41.850
or two minutes.

09:41.860 --> 09:45.340
I'm going to go over a couple of things to know about the Jupiter note book.

09:45.460 --> 09:50.290
So in the Jupiter note book you have this cell structure and the cell structure is really useful because

09:50.290 --> 09:57.070
it allows you to basically segment portions of your code something else you can do is write Mark down

09:57.070 --> 09:58.310
text into this.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.150
So I going say View toggle header you toggle toolbar.

10:02.170 --> 10:06.490
You may have already seen these I toggle it automatically if you want to change the name is no book

10:06.490 --> 10:12.520
just click here on untitled and say something like my new notebook that hit rename that renames your

10:12.520 --> 10:12.970
notebook.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.090
So if you come back out tome you'll notice it's my new notebook now.

10:17.030 --> 10:21.710
The thing is you can do is create markdown text so right now this is a code cell that I can change just

10:21.710 --> 10:22.610
to be marked down.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.910
And then I can write myself little notes here.

10:24.950 --> 10:30.420
So here are some notes and then do shift enter to have those little notes.

10:30.440 --> 10:35.540
And this also copies marked down commands so if you're familiar with Mark down you can do sizing or

10:35.600 --> 10:40.630
italics those kind of things with those marked on commands in the notebook.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.600
The next thing I want to show you is really useful and it's just tab and tab.

10:44.600 --> 10:51.570
So if you create a string so say as is a string do shift enter to run that cell.

10:52.190 --> 10:57.890
And then if you do as Dot and then hit tab you'll find a list of all the methods available for that

10:57.890 --> 10:58.510
string.

10:58.730 --> 11:03.680
Now keep in mind this string has to already be defined in a cell above.

11:03.740 --> 11:09.620
If I try to do this in the same cell so I say x is equal to string and then within the same cell I say

11:09.650 --> 11:11.430
X dots and hit tab.

11:11.460 --> 11:15.530
Nothing's going to happen because technically the Jupiter note book doesn't know that this is already

11:15.530 --> 11:16.650
a global variable.

11:16.670 --> 11:20.120
You need to run the cell in order for that to work.

11:20.140 --> 11:24.610
So then if I run this do X that tab then I can see everything.

11:24.610 --> 11:29.620
Once you have that ready to go you can do shift tab off methods to see the doc strings and you can also

11:29.620 --> 11:31.260
do this off functions.

11:31.300 --> 11:36.700
So again you can do something like T.F. session and the new shift tab here and you should be able to

11:36.700 --> 11:40.710
see the documentation string for any classes or functions or methods.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.450
Remember these need to be defined before you can see anything.

11:44.530 --> 11:44.830
All right.

11:44.830 --> 11:45.840
That's really all we need to know.

11:45.850 --> 11:51.220
But that Jupiter notebook again it's shift enter to run a cell if you want to input a cell.

11:51.220 --> 11:56.850
You could just go to sell it or insert and then say insert cell above or insert cell below.

11:57.010 --> 11:58.400
And that's really all you need to do.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.680
All right thanks everyone.

11:59.740 --> 12:00.670
I'll see you at the next lecture.
