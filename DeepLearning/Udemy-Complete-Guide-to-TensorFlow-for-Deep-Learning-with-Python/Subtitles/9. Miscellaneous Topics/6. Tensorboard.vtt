00:05.470 --> 00:09.610
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture where we're going to be showing you an awesome visualization

00:09.610 --> 00:12.280
tool that already comes built into tensor flow.

00:12.430 --> 00:18.600
And that is tensor board and it really allows you to visualize complex graphs and a very organized manner.

00:18.610 --> 00:22.430
Keep in mind that we will be using the command prompt as well as the Jupiter notebook.

00:22.480 --> 00:26.800
So go ahead and open up either your terminal or your command prompt and make sure you have your environment

00:26.800 --> 00:28.780
file ready to be activated.

00:28.780 --> 00:33.790
Let's open up a Jupiter notebook create a simple graph and then visualize it ok here and at my Jupiter

00:33.800 --> 00:38.620
notebook I've already imported tensor flow and what I'm going to do is just build out a really simple

00:38.650 --> 00:39.860
graph session.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.010
I'm going to say T.F. is equal to T.F. and I'm going to add two numbers together.

00:45.190 --> 00:54.030
They wanted to that I'm going to say B is equal to T.F. and three and four together and then I will

00:54.030 --> 00:56.270
say C is equal to T.F..

00:56.490 --> 01:01.600
And then I will multiply A and B together.

01:01.600 --> 01:08.950
So a very simple graph and then what I will do now is run the sessional say with t f session as SPSS

01:09.530 --> 01:12.230
like and say session run.

01:12.250 --> 01:18.850
And then I just actually need to run C and in fact I can print out the output of this so I can see it

01:19.170 --> 01:25.590
and I get 21 which makes sense because I basically have one plus two here which is three and then three

01:25.590 --> 01:27.130
times three plus four to seven.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.010
So if through them.

01:28.070 --> 01:29.140
21.

01:29.250 --> 01:34.620
Now if I have a really complex graph I'm not going to be able to directly interpret it just using these

01:34.620 --> 01:37.470
lines of code if I have more than just these three entries.

01:37.470 --> 01:41.240
It's going to be really hard to basically trace back where all these variables come from.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.980
So it'd be really nice if I could visualize that graph.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.380
And that's actually really easy with tensor board.

01:46.380 --> 01:51.060
So let's show you how you can do that will you end up doing is within your session where you're going

01:51.060 --> 01:53.490
to do is the very first thing of your session.

01:53.820 --> 02:00.090
You're going to say T.F. or excuse me writer is equal to see summary and then you going to call file

02:00.090 --> 02:04.020
writer and you're going to create an output file location.

02:04.020 --> 02:12.080
So I'll say it Dopp forward slash output and then of this we're going to save our session graph.

02:12.330 --> 02:17.710
And then once you're finished running your operations you're going to make sure to close your writer.

02:17.810 --> 02:18.920
So let's run that.

02:19.490 --> 02:24.560
And right now we see the same result but if we take a look at where this trooper notebook is located

02:25.010 --> 02:27.170
for my case it's located under miscellaneous topics.

02:27.170 --> 02:31.880
If I come back to the miscellaneous topics folder click on the output folder I can now see this T.F.

02:31.880 --> 02:32.800
events file.

02:32.990 --> 02:35.670
And that basically has all the information about that graph.

02:35.690 --> 02:41.050
So we're going to do now is open up our command prompt and show you how you can run tensor board.

02:41.150 --> 02:46.610
So I will open up my command prompt and inside the command prompt the first thing I want to do is make

02:46.610 --> 02:49.620
sure that I activate my deep learning environment.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.880
The reason for that is because I need to make sure that I have tensor flow available in this environment.

02:54.890 --> 02:57.140
That way I can call sensor board at the command line.

02:57.320 --> 03:03.580
Otherwise you get some sort of error saying something like tensor board not recognized the next loops.

03:03.700 --> 03:07.680
The next they're going to do is call a tensor board and then the following command.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.400
Dash dash.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.570
Well make sure there's a space there.

03:10.570 --> 03:15.940
So it's a little harder to tell my screen but I'm typing tensor board and then typing a space and then

03:15.940 --> 03:20.930
I will say dash dash log directory is equal to.

03:21.070 --> 03:24.490
And then if you're on Windows you may need to use double quotes here.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.540
And if you get an error of double quotes go ahead and try.

03:26.560 --> 03:31.360
No quotes that kind of depends on what operating system whether you use single quotes double quotes

03:31.390 --> 03:32.520
or no quotes at all.

03:32.530 --> 03:38.020
So just keep that in mind and you're going Pathans pass in the same path that you created earlier.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.610
So let me make sure I call the output.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.450
So there it is support slash output.

03:42.520 --> 03:46.340
And I can just do that because I'm located in the miscellaneous topics folder.

03:46.350 --> 03:51.640
If you want to you can write the full path out here but since I'm located in the same folder I just

03:51.640 --> 03:56.330
need to run that and I see centerboard running at this HTP.

03:56.460 --> 03:57.990
So I will go ahead and copy this.

03:57.990 --> 04:01.220
Make sure you don't copy of control c otherwise you're going to end up putting.

04:01.380 --> 04:06.360
So in my case I just did it right click that and then I will go back to my browser and paste that in

04:08.300 --> 04:08.770
and here.

04:08.780 --> 04:11.360
Now we see this awesome visualization of my graphs.

04:11.390 --> 04:17.600
So I have adding X and Y here add 1 x and y these two scalars and then they get multiplied and I can

04:17.600 --> 04:21.600
click on one of these nodes and I can see the various operations the data types expects.

04:21.620 --> 04:25.670
And then I can actually remove it from the main graph etc. and if you come over here to tensor flow

04:25.940 --> 04:32.840
there's things like downloading it to a PNB file thing to a screen if you have a very large plot or

04:32.840 --> 04:34.630
a graph you may need to do that.

04:34.670 --> 04:38.390
You can see the various runs in case you randomly fill sessions of this.

04:38.450 --> 04:42.390
You can upload graph files you can highlight this thing that says trace inputs.

04:42.410 --> 04:46.640
In this case we actually have no placeholder input so we'll just turn that off and then you can also

04:46.640 --> 04:51.020
see the graph essentially a legend telling you what the name spaces are.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.890
The operation nodes constants etc..

04:53.960 --> 04:58.870
Now as you can imagine if we have a ton of operations here this sort of automatic naming of add add

04:58.890 --> 05:03.820
1 add to multiply and multiply 3 etc. isn't actually going to be very helpful.

05:03.980 --> 05:07.300
So you can actually add names to your notes.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.810
So let me come back here and show you how you can do that.

05:10.250 --> 05:17.030
Basically every tensor flow operation has the ability of a parameter called name and you'll see this

05:17.030 --> 05:21.860
often throughout a different storyline on line where they just assign names and if they never use centerboard

05:21.860 --> 05:23.660
you might be wondering well why are they assigning the names.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.450
If we never actually use them well they're for centerboard.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.480
So let's go ahead and say this was our first ad operation and keep in mind you can't have spaces in

05:32.480 --> 05:33.060
the string.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.510
Otherwise we'll have an error there.

05:35.540 --> 05:46.620
This name we'll say is our seconds at operation and then this multiply we'll give it the name of final

05:46.710 --> 05:47.430
results.

05:49.010 --> 05:53.590
So I'm going to run these again and let's refresh our Tencent board.

05:53.640 --> 05:59.250
So when I refreshed tensor board if you take a look at what happens I end up getting my original graph

05:59.250 --> 06:02.570
here as well as this new named graph.

06:02.580 --> 06:08.670
So if you want you can edit that if we come back to our output folder you can see now I have T.F. events.

06:08.670 --> 06:11.860
So I have my old one and the one I just created.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.310
And also if you open up your command prompt it will basically report to you.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.940
Hey I found a more than one Medak Raffy wants to run.

06:18.010 --> 06:22.320
I move right in that graph with the newest event and what it means by overwrite is that it's overwriting

06:22.320 --> 06:23.480
with a new graph here.

06:23.490 --> 06:24.930
So it's adding that on top.

06:24.930 --> 06:28.520
So it's technically showing two graphs if you wanted to edit that.

06:28.620 --> 06:32.550
You could just kind of delete your old plot file or overwrite it cetera.

06:32.700 --> 06:37.950
But again pretty good news here that we don't accidentally overwrite a graph because notice you're still

06:37.950 --> 06:39.370
giving it the same output.

06:39.450 --> 06:45.000
But luckily for us censor board and sensor flow is smart enough to know that you may not want to accidentally

06:45.000 --> 06:46.130
overwrite your old stuff.

06:46.290 --> 06:50.180
So basically just keeps adding to those crafty events.

06:50.190 --> 06:50.640
All right.

06:50.780 --> 06:53.440
So you can name stuff in your graph.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.830
Well you can also do is add scope's.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.650
So to do that we're going to add in a couple of more variables here.

07:00.540 --> 07:05.380
I'm going to say 8 is equal to T.F..

07:05.420 --> 07:10.710
And let's go ahead and add one hundred and 200 together and it will give us the name

07:13.470 --> 07:19.310
a add the names aren't really important here is just for demonstration purposes we'll make another variable.

07:19.370 --> 07:26.840
Well another operation really not really a central variable and this one's going to be called at 300

07:26.840 --> 07:34.700
and 400 will name this be at.

07:34.890 --> 07:37.690
And then we have this final result of C..

07:37.830 --> 07:40.230
So what we'll do is we'll do the following.

07:40.230 --> 07:45.720
We're going to add a two or multiply and B to.

07:45.790 --> 07:55.110
So let's add those and we'll say A2 is T.F. and I'm going to multiply the result of an 8 1 and they

07:55.120 --> 07:57.310
will say BE2 is equal to T.F..

07:57.310 --> 08:05.960
Multiply the results of B and B one.

08:05.970 --> 08:11.730
OK so we can so far follow along with the general logic because we kind of wrote this from the start.

08:11.890 --> 08:17.200
But if you begin to just see this as code you kind of have no idea what's going on just at a quick glance

08:17.470 --> 08:23.050
but luckily if tensor board will be able to see that now what we're going to do is we can see here that

08:23.050 --> 08:28.780
our code is organized in blocks and we can actually project that organization with the use of scopes

08:29.200 --> 08:30.540
in tensor board.

08:30.850 --> 08:37.060
So what we end up doing is wow are the finance operations we can do the following we'll say with T.F.

08:38.130 --> 08:42.840
name scope and then you pass in the name or what you want the scope to be called so we can say like

08:42.870 --> 08:45.320
Operation a.

08:45.530 --> 08:48.510
And then we have a colon here and then you write in as a block.

08:48.510 --> 08:54.090
So just tab and dance all the operations you want to find within that scope and what that scope is going

08:54.090 --> 09:00.850
to look like with intenser board is basically a big grey box that it can expand.

09:00.860 --> 09:06.200
So then the next thing to do here is say if name scope and this will be all be called Operation be

09:09.080 --> 09:14.050
inlets in that this is now all go within the scope and you can actually have some scopes.

09:14.050 --> 09:18.730
So if you have like another set of operations inside the scope you could have also had with T.F. name

09:18.740 --> 09:22.180
scope operation you know Delta A or something like that.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.280
OK so now we have these two scopes.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.100
So let's go ahead and check this out.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.470
So we'll run these again.

09:30.780 --> 09:33.260
And now I'm getting a much larger number which kind of makes sense.

09:33.410 --> 09:40.140
And if I refresh my tensor board what's going to happen now is this third graph looks a little different.

09:40.190 --> 09:44.390
It now has these operations and those that are actually kind of named and what you can do is you can

09:44.390 --> 09:49.460
expand these operations so you can double click on that plus sign and then see the graph that is within

09:49.460 --> 09:50.220
that operation.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.060
So there was my first that my 8 and I multiplied it and that's operation.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.340
I can expand on this.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.010
Click on that and then you can see operation B.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.830
So now this allows you to organize really large graphs.

10:00.830 --> 10:05.780
So when you see these really awesome pictures of tensor board running in action they're usually using

10:05.780 --> 10:09.200
these operations so you can see here the really nice flow.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.790
So we start off really simple graph that we named our nodes and then we group them together in operations.

10:14.930 --> 10:17.690
And like I mentioned before we can have subgroups here.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.340
So if you wanted a scope within a scope you could have done that as well.

10:21.340 --> 10:21.650
All right.

10:21.680 --> 10:25.810
Now so I want to know that there's actually a lot more to censor board than just visualizing graphs.

10:25.910 --> 10:30.770
If you click here where it says interactive you can also see options for visualizing things like distribution's

10:30.770 --> 10:36.310
histograms teks profile images and sensorial actually has really great documentation on this.

10:36.320 --> 10:41.240
It basically has a censor board tutorial walkthrough for visualizing learning grafters ization histogram

10:41.240 --> 10:42.030
dashboards.

10:42.140 --> 10:45.530
But I also just want to walk you through not just graphs but also histograms.

10:45.650 --> 10:50.690
So let's try to do that going to come back here to censor board.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.310
And what I'm want to do is copy and paste some code this code directly from the documentation so you

10:55.310 --> 11:00.680
can always reference it there or just copy and paste from the actual notebook for this lecture.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.800
So I will copy and paste this but all I'm doing here is we're creating a placeholder k just like you

11:05.790 --> 11:06.270
would.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.280
And then we're making a normal distribution.

11:08.300 --> 11:14.240
But what's interesting about this distribution is it has a shifting mean so it has the shape 1000 different

11:14.250 --> 11:17.780
than normal but the mean is defined by this placeholder.

11:17.780 --> 11:22.960
So basically have some sort of distribution that's slowly moving depending on this.

11:23.330 --> 11:25.730
And then I'm going to record the histogram.

11:25.730 --> 11:31.880
Now this T.F. summary histogram is a way that you can actually record things like variables or weights.

11:31.880 --> 11:37.400
So if you recall back we're creating our own models we have T.F. variable you could pass that T.F. variable

11:37.400 --> 11:42.680
here and then give it some sort of name or file path and then we're going to do is we'll create a session

11:42.680 --> 11:43.390
here.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.460
So let's actually say this.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.730
Say with C-f session

11:51.440 --> 11:55.300
as SPSS so it follows the same path we've been doing.

11:55.340 --> 11:59.120
We're going to say that we have a writer it's equal to a summary writer and we're actually going to

11:59.120 --> 12:00.770
follow this into another directory.

12:00.830 --> 12:07.790
We'll say it goes to this temporary folder histogram example and then we'll say summaries and we're

12:07.790 --> 12:10.930
going to say summary merge all.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.460
And what this does is going to merge all your T.F. summaries into a single node.

12:15.620 --> 12:20.210
So in this case we actually just have one T.F. that some recall but a lot of times you'll have lots

12:20.210 --> 12:22.450
of histogram calls and you'll be able to see them all.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.240
So we say T.F. that summary that merge all and then we're going to set up a loop.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.640
So let's go ahead and do this.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.590
Inside the session we're going to say Ed is equal to 400.

12:30.630 --> 12:35.660
And we'll say for step in range and what we're going to do is say our current k value and make sure

12:35.660 --> 12:37.510
my invitation is correct.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.120
What's our current value.

12:39.140 --> 12:44.990
Is it called Step divided by the flow then then we have this summary which is going to be some is equal

12:44.990 --> 12:48.950
to session run you're going to run our summaries and we're going to feed it some feed dictionary of

12:48.950 --> 12:52.510
those values which in this case is just that 400.

12:52.550 --> 12:54.100
Are those values to 400.

12:54.380 --> 12:58.990
And then we're also going to be calling our writer to add that summary.

12:59.210 --> 13:04.990
And then at the very end of all this we're going to say writer and we're going to close that off.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.380
OK let's go in and run this maternal on typos here.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.890
And it looks like it ran correctly.

13:09.890 --> 13:14.900
So what we're going to do is recall tensor board actually pointed to this histogram example because

13:14.900 --> 13:16.800
right now it's just pointed at the output.

13:16.850 --> 13:19.100
So we'll come back to our command prompt.

13:19.100 --> 13:30.420
I'm going to say control see here and then we'll say tensor board space dash dash log directory is equal

13:30.420 --> 13:30.910
to.

13:30.930 --> 13:36.470
And then we're going to pass that file so's I believe Tim and make sure I get the name correct.

13:36.490 --> 13:42.720
It was his Gramp underscore example histogram underscore example.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.870
So let's run that make sure we don't get any errors.

13:45.210 --> 13:46.260
Ok looks like it's running.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.170
So I'm going to now refresh this page.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.230
So I'll come over here refreshed that you are ill.

13:52.470 --> 13:55.120
And now I can see I have my distributions.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.250
Next we see that distribution.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.760
Let me zoom in here so you guys can see it as well.

13:59.040 --> 14:03.330
And I can see here the distribution as it moves throughout the various values from where we have those

14:03.360 --> 14:04.740
400 different values.

14:04.890 --> 14:09.120
And then you click here on histograms and I can see what's really cool is this moving histogram.

14:09.120 --> 14:14.940
And this is a really cool way to visualize your weights as they move and kind of center on some particular

14:14.940 --> 14:15.420
values.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.750
But again this is T.F. summary for histograms.

14:18.750 --> 14:24.480
So essentially summarize them just to review that you call T.F. but some read the histogram you pass

14:24.480 --> 14:25.500
and the name of what you want.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.250
This particular one to be called in this case we called it moving mean.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.360
And so if you come over here it relates as moving mean.

14:32.460 --> 14:35.540
And then we can end up doing is merging all of them.

14:35.550 --> 14:39.480
So you can have several histograms one for your biases one for your weights and you can check out all

14:39.480 --> 14:41.520
those examples in the documentation.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.770
All right so those are the basics of using tensor board.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.270
Definitely check out the documentation.

14:45.270 --> 14:47.280
There's lots of useful links there for you.

14:47.320 --> 14:52.290
I'm going to just bring it in real quick so you can see it over here at my browser so you'll notice

14:52.290 --> 14:54.890
that if you go to tensor flowed or slash get started.

14:54.890 --> 14:59.210
Slash Well if you just go to get started here you'll notice there's lots of Tauriel.

14:59.220 --> 15:04.470
But at the very end there's three full tensor board tutorial so visualizing learning of tensor board

15:04.770 --> 15:09.900
there's also this great video here that's kind of really popular on YouTube where they discuss how tensor

15:09.900 --> 15:11.280
board works.

15:11.390 --> 15:12.620
They can come over here.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.680
It'll give you more information.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.940
There's also T.F. That's somebody that's scaler so you can do things like plot out your last throughout

15:17.940 --> 15:18.420
time.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.190
Summary operations etc..

15:20.220 --> 15:25.140
It has tons of example code and it's relatively easy to understand now that you understand how to work

15:25.140 --> 15:25.770
with tensor flow.

15:25.770 --> 15:31.860
It's essentially just calling a summary scalar or summary histogram or summary file writer to whatever

15:31.860 --> 15:32.970
you want to save.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.820
So you can check out that visually like visualizing learning to Tauriel that's the main one.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.440
And then there's also things like Graph visualization which you've actually basically already covered

15:40.740 --> 15:45.330
so you can have those operations those nodes and then there's also the histogram dashboard which you

15:45.510 --> 15:47.890
also basically cover it already for you.

15:47.910 --> 15:48.480
All right.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.820
So check that out.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.400
It's a lot of fun to play with.

15:51.410 --> 15:56.370
You won't use it too much throughout this course because we're really focused on learning tensor flow.

15:56.370 --> 16:01.200
This is a really cool way to visualize and makes us feel look really pretty but it won't be the actual

16:01.200 --> 16:04.230
main focus of a lot of our projects throughout the course.

16:04.230 --> 16:04.630
Okay.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.540
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
