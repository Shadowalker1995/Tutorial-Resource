Welcome everyone to the crash course review exercises.

00:09.290 --> 00:13.580
So if you went ahead and went through those Crash Course Lectures we have a little note book as a quick

00:13.580 --> 00:18.650
review of a couple of questions for you to answer so you can find that no book under crash course basics

00:18.650 --> 00:20.600
crash course review exercises.

00:20.710 --> 00:24.570
And there's also a solution note book that we're going to go through in the very next lecture.

00:24.740 --> 00:28.430
Let's quickly have a quick overview of the review exercises notebook.

00:28.430 --> 00:28.660
All right.

00:28.660 --> 00:31.400
Here I am at the crash course review exercises notebook.

00:31.400 --> 00:36.500
The basic idea here is that you'll have some sort of instructions in bold and then a cell below for

00:36.500 --> 00:40.910
you to execute them in for example the very first one just ask you to import the libraries that we've

00:40.910 --> 00:42.000
been working with.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.050
So you could say something like.

00:43.070 --> 00:47.040
Import some PI and P and as a quick little tip.

00:47.210 --> 00:49.940
If you do shift enter that will execute a cell.

00:50.060 --> 00:55.610
If you want to insert a cell below this one you can do alt enter and it will also execute the cell but

00:55.610 --> 00:57.040
then insert a cell below.

00:57.230 --> 00:58.790
So that's really nice that we can do.

00:58.820 --> 01:02.300
All tenter all tents are all tenter so you can insert cells below.

01:02.300 --> 01:08.160
In case you need more cells or more space than what you want to do is non-firing them see that it asks

01:08.160 --> 01:09.410
you to create a matrix.

01:09.450 --> 01:15.440
Then later on after you create that matrix it asks you to do some sort of visualization of that matrix.

01:15.480 --> 01:20.700
They also ask you to do things like add a title add a color bar and then there's a little bonus aspect

01:20.700 --> 01:21.230
to this.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.740
It asks you to how can you change the aspect of this show plot.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.070
So there's a parameter called aspect there to play around with.

01:27.210 --> 01:30.090
And notice there's a little link here that kind of gives you a hint.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.990
Then you go ahead and use Panas data frame to read in that player Ray as a data frame.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.560
We actually should have to do that earlier in the lectures.

01:37.740 --> 01:43.440
Then you'll create a scatterplot using panderers then you will scale the data to have a minimum of zero

01:43.530 --> 01:47.820
maximum value of 1 using Cyke learn the preprocessing you went through.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.870
Then once you've done that you'll go ahead and create a data frame and then perform a train test pilot.

01:54.150 --> 01:54.650
OK.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.300
Basically right in line of everything we just covered.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.110
Those are all the basic tools that we're going to be using throughout the rest of the course when we

02:01.110 --> 02:03.750
actually discuss neural networks and sensor flow.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.800
Thinks everyone in the next lecture will go over the solutions.
