00:05.820 --> 00:08.920
Hello everyone and welcome to the course overview lecture.

00:09.150 --> 00:10.820
I have a quick favor to ask of you.

00:10.820 --> 00:14.530
Please don't skip this lecture even if you've already taken one of my courses before.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.050
This is just going to be a really useful quick lecture on where to find a lot of important things for

00:19.050 --> 00:20.040
the course.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.010
So welcome to the course.

00:22.030 --> 00:26.790
I'm going to cover the best practices for taking this course where you can find the notes for this course.

00:26.840 --> 00:31.250
How to ask questions to quickly get help and then a little bit of certification and then I'm also going

00:31.250 --> 00:37.540
to talk about the curriculum for the course Ok far first best practices for the course are concerned.

00:37.570 --> 00:41.040
Keep in mind that videos can be sped up up to speed.

00:41.050 --> 00:44.980
They can also be slowed down so I tend to talk at a pretty steady pace.

00:44.980 --> 00:50.110
So me personally I would actually probably speed up the videos the way I consume information.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.610
But maybe if English isn't your first language or you want to slow things down you can also slow the

00:54.610 --> 00:55.930
speed of the videos.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.860
You can also check the video playback quality.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.410
So there's a little gear setting.

00:59.410 --> 01:00.840
If you notice the videos are blurry.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.320
Are you having any trouble with them.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.880
You can always up the quality.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.810
All the videos are uploaded in 10 ADP.

01:06.820 --> 01:12.280
Also you can use the curriculum tab to quickly navigate between lectures and if you have any other problems

01:12.460 --> 01:17.190
with the platform maybe the videos are taking too long or they're buffering.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.180
You can always email a question to support you to me dot com and they they're happy to help you out.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.080
Or you can submit a request directly at the U to me support page.

01:26.110 --> 01:29.260
Again I only make the lectures and the notes and content.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.150
I don't actually control the platform.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.330
So for platform issues please go ahead and send an email to support UMT dot com.

01:35.410 --> 01:38.270
Lot of great folks there and they're happy to help you out.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.300
Two more quick notes.

01:39.340 --> 01:44.680
As far as best practices for taking the course I would recommend you always watch the videos and reference

01:44.680 --> 01:48.970
the notebook's tensor fluid deep learning can be quite a complicated subject.

01:48.970 --> 01:53.740
So I tried my best to really clarify things during the videos and then you can always reference the

01:53.740 --> 01:56.530
notebooks because the code itself is pretty complex.

01:56.650 --> 02:01.900
So you want to make sure that the code you're writing matches the notebooks Exactly.

02:01.900 --> 02:07.540
Also I recommend you always use the Course environment file with the provided notebooks and when I say

02:07.540 --> 02:11.500
with the provided notebooks I don't just mean just copying and paste code from the notebooks.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.640
Try running the notebook files directly.

02:13.660 --> 02:19.720
It's really really easy to make a typo and a lot of this code goes for many lines and it's quite complicated

02:19.960 --> 02:25.330
because it's a pretty complex topic so the notes are there for you so you can always reference them.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.740
OK so speaking of the notes where can you find them.

02:29.890 --> 02:35.470
Well the notebooks and all the data files we use are available as a large zip file and it's a resource

02:35.470 --> 02:36.840
link in this lecture.

02:36.850 --> 02:40.510
It's also available for you in the very next lecture as a resource link.

02:40.510 --> 02:43.950
It's the same file so whichever one you want go ahead and download it.

02:43.990 --> 02:48.310
It's a pretty large zip file because it includes some larger data sets so it may take a little bit of

02:48.310 --> 02:49.470
time to download.

02:49.780 --> 02:54.430
As far as the slides that you're going to see throughout the course these are all Google slides and

02:54.430 --> 02:57.950
they're linked to in the first lecture of their respective section.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.870
So what I mean by that.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.310
If you're looking for the slides for the convolutional in your own networks section you just go to that

03:03.550 --> 03:08.390
sections first lecture and you should see as a resource link the link to the Google slides.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.220
Again why you're watching this video.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.830
You should see like a little blue or some sort of pop up a little link and it should take you to the

03:14.830 --> 03:19.890
resources Okay now how to ask questions and quickly get help.

03:19.910 --> 03:21.030
During the course.

03:21.290 --> 03:26.530
So the first thing you should do is verify that you ran the provided notebook file from that zip file

03:26.900 --> 03:32.320
and you did it inside the provided environment file that we'll talk about during the installation lecture.

03:32.510 --> 03:38.000
All the Knope the code has been checked against this provided environment file so it should all run

03:38.120 --> 03:43.060
if you're running that exact notebook in the environment file with no other edits.

03:43.160 --> 03:46.130
So keep that in mind if you're getting any syntax errors.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.020
It's probably because you copied and pasted something wrong or you have a small typo or you're not running

03:51.020 --> 03:52.490
it in the provided environment.

03:52.490 --> 03:55.650
So always make sure that you're doing that.

03:55.850 --> 04:01.600
All right so let's quickly go over some steps for getting answers to your questions in a quick and reliable

04:01.600 --> 04:02.460
manner.

04:02.470 --> 04:06.700
The first thing I would always suggest is that you check that you actually ran the notebook and that

04:06.700 --> 04:07.750
you also check the videos.

04:07.750 --> 04:12.790
A lot of times the videos I make some comments trying to preemptively answer questions that I may think

04:12.820 --> 04:13.620
arise.

04:13.630 --> 04:18.190
So if you're concerned about a particular section of the notebook go ahead and see if you can find that

04:18.190 --> 04:18.730
in the video.

04:18.730 --> 04:21.930
When I go over that I usually make some comments about it.

04:22.030 --> 04:27.160
If not what I would recommend doing is just a quick Google search of whatever area are getting or whatever

04:27.160 --> 04:28.200
question you have.

04:28.360 --> 04:34.270
There's usually lots of useful pre asked questions on stack overflow that will cover the same topics

04:34.270 --> 04:36.350
or same errors that you're experiencing.

04:36.430 --> 04:40.420
And that way you can answer your questions in just a few seconds through a quick Google search.

04:40.420 --> 04:45.940
So again with such a complex topic Google is your friend and stack overflow is a great resource and

04:45.940 --> 04:49.780
I highly recommend that the first thing you do whenever you have a question is just do a quick Google

04:49.780 --> 04:52.030
search or do a search on stack overflow.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.350
OK let's say you still can't find your answer.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.710
Well you can always search the Frequently Asked Questions lexer.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.440
That's the very next lecture.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.850
Now those are just general questions.

05:00.850 --> 05:05.890
They usually have to do more if the course or getting certified or where you can find the notes that

05:05.890 --> 05:06.560
sort of thing.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.700
Or maybe even the installation process.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.830
If you have a question that's more specific to maybe how a line in the notebook works and you didn't

05:15.040 --> 05:19.390
get your answer either through stack overflow or through the videos that I would recommend the search

05:19.420 --> 05:21.350
previous question and answer post.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.690
We're going to end up having thousands of students in this course and in the getter channel as well.

05:25.810 --> 05:31.030
So you want to search those question answer forums to see if your questions are already answered there.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.710
All right so let's say you tried all that you did a google search.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.490
Try looking on stack overflow.

05:35.590 --> 05:39.970
You search the Frequently Asked Questions lecture you search the Q&amp;A forums and still can't find an

05:39.970 --> 05:40.610
answer.

05:40.630 --> 05:41.310
No problem.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.250
That's the point of the Q&amp;A forms.

05:43.300 --> 05:48.190
So make sure that when you're posting to the Q&amp;A forums you include your main error or your main point

05:48.190 --> 05:48.780
in confusion.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.780
Try to make this as clear as possible.

05:51.010 --> 05:56.380
And also it's really helpful if you link to resources or Stack Overflow links that you've already seen.

05:56.380 --> 06:00.760
That way you don't accidentally just get a reply to a stack overflow link that you've already seen and

06:00.760 --> 06:02.260
maybe they didn't understand.

06:02.260 --> 06:06.940
I would also really recommend that if you're stuck on a particular point in the lecture that you include

06:06.940 --> 06:08.190
a video time stamp.

06:08.230 --> 06:11.260
So let's say minute 12 of lecture 45.

06:11.260 --> 06:15.970
That way we know what you're referencing and if necessary include a screenshot.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.490
If your errors are pretty strange or it's more of a visual thing that's hard to describe screenshots

06:20.500 --> 06:21.830
really help out a lot.

06:22.090 --> 06:26.830
If you have a particular installation issue make sure you include information about your operating system

06:27.070 --> 06:30.660
and the particular procedure you followed OK.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.170
Quick note on certification.

06:32.220 --> 06:35.280
You can check out the resource link for the support page details.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.150
Me has a support page that goes through the full details of how to get certified.

06:39.150 --> 06:44.370
If you take the course and as a quick note if you have any issues with your certificate maybe it's taking

06:44.370 --> 06:46.450
too long or you just want to change the name.

06:46.470 --> 06:49.900
Go get an email support you to me that again they're happy to help you out.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.760
I don't actually control anything about certification.

06:52.770 --> 06:54.800
It's all done automatically through to me.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.500
So support me dot com can always help and they're happy to answer any questions about your certification

07:01.000 --> 07:01.250
OK.

07:01.260 --> 07:04.740
Let's quickly describe the course curriculum right after this.

07:04.740 --> 07:10.260
We're going to talk about the installation and setup of python and flow and your environment.

07:10.710 --> 07:15.330
Then after that we're going to do a very quick overview of machine learning just a little quick refresher

07:15.600 --> 07:18.400
so you can get your mindset ready for the course.

07:18.450 --> 07:22.320
Then we have what we call a crash course section in that section of the course.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.850
We're going to go over things like pi Panchos and sikat learn.

07:25.860 --> 07:30.080
If you've already taken one of my courses such as the Python for data science and machine learning boot

07:30.080 --> 07:34.740
camp you may already be familiar of those libraries so you don't actually need to do the crash course

07:34.740 --> 07:37.030
in which case you can skip it completely.

07:37.110 --> 07:39.040
Or if you want to make sure you understand.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.540
Go ahead and check out the crash course exercises and the solutions.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.370
Just so you can check your understanding.

07:44.370 --> 07:45.730
Again that crash course.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.760
A little bit optional depending on what your prior experiences with those libraries.

07:49.980 --> 07:54.390
OK so you did the crash course then we're going to move on to an introduction to neural networks.

07:54.510 --> 07:58.130
So in that section of the Course we actually don't touch tensor flow.

07:58.280 --> 08:02.290
Well we end up doing as we go through the very basics of neural networks.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.600
We have a very shallow learning curve there.

08:04.710 --> 08:09.030
I don't want to just like rev up the engines and then have you be lost at the very first sight of a

08:09.030 --> 08:09.660
neural network.

08:09.660 --> 08:14.580
So instead what we do is we have a very slow general introduction to neural networks and then what's

08:14.580 --> 08:21.000
really cool is we manually create a neural network framework using python that sort of mimics the tensor

08:21.000 --> 08:21.990
flow framework.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.710
So actually in that intersection we don't touch tensor flow.

08:24.720 --> 08:30.090
Instead we try to build out a little copy of tensor flow manually that way once we actually reach sensor

08:30.090 --> 08:32.890
flow you have a full and complete understanding.

08:33.060 --> 08:38.010
After that section is complete we then have what I refer to as the tensor flow sections.

08:38.010 --> 08:42.660
And these are the sections of the course that really tackle a particular network topic and show you

08:42.660 --> 08:45.060
how you can work with tensor flow.

08:45.240 --> 08:51.510
So they typically include a theory lecture then an implementation example intenser flow and then some

08:51.510 --> 08:54.230
sort of exercise free to follow intenser flow.

08:54.240 --> 08:59.290
So those are all going to be dependent on whatever topic we're discussing so you'll have a tensor flow

08:59.290 --> 09:03.890
section on recurrent and that works convolutional neural networks auto encoders etc..

09:03.960 --> 09:09.300
Everything we talked about in the previous video and last but not least I just want to give a HUGE THANK

09:09.300 --> 09:14.040
YOU to all the students who have rolled not just in this course but all my courses it really means a

09:14.040 --> 09:18.100
lot to me and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to teach you.

09:18.210 --> 09:18.730
All right.

09:18.990 --> 09:22.850
So without any further ado let's go continue on with the rest of the course.
