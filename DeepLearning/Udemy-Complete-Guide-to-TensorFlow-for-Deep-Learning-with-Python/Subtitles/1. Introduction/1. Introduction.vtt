00:00.530 --> 00:04.920
Welcome to the complete guide to tensor flow for deep learning of Python.

00:04.990 --> 00:08.490
My name is Jose Portsea and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:08.500 --> 00:14.470
I currently have over a quarter of a million students on me teaching various topics such as Python machine

00:14.470 --> 00:16.950
learning data science finance and more.

00:17.110 --> 00:22.990
I'm also a technical corporate trainer for Fortune 500 companies and this course will teach you how

00:22.990 --> 00:28.250
to use Google's tensor framework to perform the latest cutting edge techniques in machine learning.

00:28.300 --> 00:32.890
This course is based off the same deep learning material I've developed for some of the world's top

00:32.890 --> 00:34.180
tech companies.

00:34.690 --> 00:38.250
Let's give you a quick overview of the course curriculum.

00:38.740 --> 00:43.920
We'll start off a brief crash course in the central Python data science library including some Peiffer

00:43.930 --> 00:50.520
numerical processing Pandurs for data analysis that plotted for visualization utilizing sikat learn

00:50.520 --> 00:52.510
for processing machine learning data sets.

00:53.850 --> 00:58.260
Once we done with the crash course we'll focus on building an intuitive understanding of the basics

00:58.260 --> 01:05.670
of neural that works including trance activation functions back propagation and more after those neural

01:05.670 --> 01:06.550
network basics.

01:06.570 --> 01:10.370
We'll explore how to unlock the full potential of deep learning with tensor flow.

01:11.330 --> 01:15.170
In this course we cover a variety of ways.

01:15.380 --> 01:20.300
We'll begin the course by understanding basic artificial neural networks such as densely connected networks

01:20.610 --> 01:27.050
will learn how to use these for basic classification and regression tests afterwards we'll work on understanding

01:27.050 --> 01:34.520
convolutional here that works eventually using them to solve complex image classification tasks that

01:34.520 --> 01:38.990
will move on to creating recurrent neural networks including the latest topics in the field such as

01:38.990 --> 01:44.390
long or short term memory units and gaitered recurrent recurrent that works you'll be able to analyze

01:44.390 --> 01:50.890
sequences of data such as Time series will also cover other models such as the words of an algorithm

01:50.890 --> 01:56.100
for word and beddings allowing us to map individual words to vectors and explore the relationships between

01:57.840 --> 02:05.850
will cover how to use auto encoders perform unsupervised tasks that works this course even covers advanced

02:05.850 --> 02:10.690
topics such as generative adversarial networks and how to use reinforcement learning algorithms.

02:10.830 --> 02:17.900
The open AI will teach networks how to solve tasks such as playing video games of this course you'll

02:17.900 --> 02:23.120
get clear video explanations for every topic including easy to understand slides to cover theoretical

02:23.120 --> 02:29.130
aspects in an intuitive way and fully coded notebooks to easily reference the code shown in the course.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.740
Not only do you get great technical content but you'll also get access to our online question and answer

02:35.740 --> 02:40.910
forms and or chat room recone go for quick help and talk with thousands of other students.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.960
Upon completion of this course you'll also get a certificate of completion that you can post on your

02:45.960 --> 02:51.650
LinkedIn profile to show off to your colleagues and potential employers all of this comes with a 30

02:51.650 --> 02:56.640
day money back guarantee so you can try the entire course risk free.

02:56.650 --> 03:01.200
