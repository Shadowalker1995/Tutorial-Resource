Welcome back everyone to this series of lectures.

00:07.470 --> 00:10.800
We're going to be building out a recurrent neural network with tent's flows.

00:10.840 --> 00:16.420
API now that we understand the various possible improvements for recurrent neural networks we're going

00:16.420 --> 00:23.690
to use tensor Flo's built in T.F. thought and functionality to solve time series and sequence problems.

00:23.740 --> 00:29.600
So let's recall our original sequence thought exercise we are given a sequence one two three four five

00:29.600 --> 00:30.460
six.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.490
And now the question arises Can we predict this sequence shifted one time step forward and hopefully

00:36.490 --> 00:39.560
you would end up predicting two three four five six seven.

00:39.730 --> 00:45.410
And if this one two three four five six was part of a larger data set as a treating batch you wouldn't

00:45.460 --> 00:51.370
hopefully be able to confirm that 7 was that correct sequence shift at one time step forward.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.410
But what about this time series.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.250
This is a harder problem for someone to actually solve.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.670
And this is the exact problem we're going to try to give our recurrent neural network.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.270
If you were to actually visualize this time series data you would hopefully just realize that it's a

01:06.260 --> 01:07.380
sign of x.

01:07.490 --> 01:13.130
So we're going to be feeding in a time series that looks like that top time series from 0 all the way

01:13.130 --> 01:21.410
to negative 0.2 eights and then we want our actual model to spit back out a time series shifted over

01:21.500 --> 01:22.570
one timestep.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.510
So then we no longer have that initial 0.

01:24.530 --> 01:28.520
But it's that towards the end it went ahead and predicted 0.6 5.

01:28.550 --> 01:32.910
But keep in mind it's actually trying to generate the entire time series.

01:32.930 --> 01:36.200
So it's not just grabbing the previous values and sticking them in.

01:36.350 --> 01:39.910
It's going to attempt to generate the entire time series shift that over 1.

01:39.920 --> 01:45.480
So you may get small errors throughout that entire time series so we're going to start by creating a

01:45.480 --> 01:49.530
recurrent year all that work that attempts to predict the time series shifted over one unit into the

01:49.530 --> 01:53.960
future then we'll attempt to generate new sequences with a seed series.

01:55.610 --> 02:00.950
So going to first create a simple class to generate sign of x and also grab random batches of sign of

02:00.950 --> 02:01.560
x.

02:01.640 --> 02:07.520
So we'll have some time series data class and it's going to be able to initiate or generate sign effects

02:07.640 --> 02:08.690
as we see here.

02:08.990 --> 02:12.380
But it's also going to be able to then feed in batches of training sets.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.640
So here we can see this training batch.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.590
This is part of sign of x.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.570
So if we were to view it overlapping sign of t it would look something like this.

02:20.570 --> 02:27.080
So basically the batches that we're going to feed into our model are just going to be batches or groupings

02:27.170 --> 02:29.040
of this sign of the algorithm.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.560
So those orange stars represent a single training instance.

02:33.580 --> 02:39.790
So then when we actually train the model and attempt to predict a new time series shifted one step ahead

02:39.850 --> 02:41.250
it's going to look like this.

02:41.260 --> 02:44.890
So the train model you're going to give it a training instance.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.930
So those are those blue points there.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.630
And then you have a target which are the black points.

02:49.630 --> 02:55.030
So that's the target shifted over one time step and then hopefully that model is going to attempt to

02:55.030 --> 03:00.100
predict what that time series is going to look like shifted over one time step and you can see here

03:00.100 --> 03:05.200
that we are off on some points not perfectly centered especially the very first point is pretty way

03:05.200 --> 03:09.260
off but you can see that last point is almost right on top of its target.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.300
So obviously you can still tune this and try to get better predictions but this is the main idea that

03:13.300 --> 03:14.230
we're trying to do.

03:14.320 --> 03:19.660
We give it a time series and have it generate a time series shifted over one time step into the future

03:20.930 --> 03:21.560
afterwards.

03:21.590 --> 03:26.620
We're going to be using the same model to generate much longer time series given a seed series.

03:26.810 --> 03:34.460
So if we take a look at the previous use of the model we gave it a training instance essentially a sequence

03:34.580 --> 03:40.290
in this time series and then asked it to predict a time series shifted over by one timestep.

03:40.310 --> 03:45.950
Now we're going to do later on is give it again a seed series except this time we're going to ask it

03:46.130 --> 03:49.710
to predict way past just one time step forward.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.890
In fact we'll ask it to generate many many times step forward.

03:53.090 --> 03:59.110
So you can see here that red represents the seed series given in this case we just fed it straight zeros

03:59.450 --> 04:04.190
and then it attempts to generate a sign you saw it a wave and you could see it's pretty cool.

04:04.190 --> 04:10.590
That is generating this just based off of what it knows from learning about the sign of x function.

04:10.670 --> 04:15.770
And here you can see it's a bit of a sloppy sinusoidal wave and it only goes from negatives or 0.6 to

04:15.880 --> 04:20.480
0.4 and that's because you're feeding it straight zeros as it seed series.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.360
However if you were to actually feed it sign of x in the very beginning so we feed it that red portion

04:26.690 --> 04:31.540
you can see that it predicts a something much closer to sign of x.

04:31.550 --> 04:35.930
All right let's get started in the next lecture will open up a Jupiter note book and start by creating

04:35.990 --> 04:37.670
the time series data class.
