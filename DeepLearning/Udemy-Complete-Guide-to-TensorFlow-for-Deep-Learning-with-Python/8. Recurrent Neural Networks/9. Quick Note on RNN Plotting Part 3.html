<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>Just wanted to point out a typo/mistake in this last part of the videos, we accidentally plotted the wrong thing and got a perfect sine wave.</p><p>There are two main issues/typos that we can fix.</p><p>1. The first one is that&nbsp;<strong>len(training_instance) - num_time_steps = 0,</strong> so the model is not going through any iteration at all. This should be replaced with <strong>len(ts_data.x_data)-num_timesteps .</strong><br></p><p>2. Also we accidentally plotted&nbsp;<strong>ts.data.y_true&nbsp;</strong>which is the real data instead of the prediction, it should have been&nbsp;<strong>training_instance&nbsp;</strong>instead (after fixing the above point).</p><p>Here is a screenshot that displays the differences:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2017-12-20_18-32-38-f086606804ce1dd02b60051fa28c8bf0.png" data-s3="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2017-12-20_18-32-38-f086606804ce1dd02b60051fa28c8bf0.png"></figure>
