<p>Hi Everyone!</p>

<p>During the video lectures you'll hear me mention extra resources, instead of having them scattered throughout the lectures, I decided to place them all here. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Wikipedia Article for General Info on Reinforcement Learning</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning</p>

<p>Simpler Reinforcement Learning API with Keras. I&nbsp;would recommend checking this out if you plan to do RL in the future, its a lot easier to play with this than manually implement techniques in TF.</p>

<p>Berkeley Course on RL and DL:</p>

<p>Some great books on RL:</p>

<p>*&nbsp;Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Reinforcement Learning.&nbsp;<br>* Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig. Artificial Intelligence. A Modern Approach.<br>*&nbsp;Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
