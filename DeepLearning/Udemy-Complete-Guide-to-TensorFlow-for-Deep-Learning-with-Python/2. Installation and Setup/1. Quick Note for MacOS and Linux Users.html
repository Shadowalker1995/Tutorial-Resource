<p>Hi Everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Special note for MacOS and Linux Users,</strong> the tfdl_env.yml file may give you this error:&nbsp;</p>







<ol><li>ResolvePackageNotFound: - icu 57.1 vc14_0</li></ol>







<p>Or something similar.&nbsp;If that is the case, I&nbsp;have created alternate environment files (.yml files) .</p>



<p><strong>Link to alternate&nbsp;.yml file&nbsp;for MacOS&nbsp;Users:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;You don't need to sign up for dropbox, just click the "No Thanks, continue to view" button at the bottom, then go to the top right and click download. </strong>(I would have uploaded this direct to udemy, but .yml files aren't allowed).</p>



<p>Once you've downloaded that .yml file, just use it instead of the .yml file mentioned in the installation and setup lecture.</p><p><strong>Alternative Option is to just download the few necessary libraries manually once you have Anaconda:</strong></p><p>Step 1: Create an Environment</p>

<p>At the command line run:</p>

<p><code>conda create -n tfdeeplearning python=3.5</code>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 2: Install the libraries as you need them (there are only 6 you need to do). At the command line (with you environment activated) run the following:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
conda install jupyter
conda install numpy
conda install pandas
conda install scikit-learn
conda install matplotlib
pip install --upgrade tensorflow 
</pre><p><br></p>
