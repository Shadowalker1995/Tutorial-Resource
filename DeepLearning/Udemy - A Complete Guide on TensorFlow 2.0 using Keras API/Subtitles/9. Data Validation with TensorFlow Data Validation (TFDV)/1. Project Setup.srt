Hello everyone and welcome to this biking tutorial.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,910
In this video we are going to start with our data validation project.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,510
We are going to complete this project by utilizing the tensor flow data validation package which is

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,540
a part of the technology stack called Tesla flow.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,750
Extended the Tesla flow extended is a built around tons of flow to put any model in production end to

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,190
end from data validation to serving it on a server.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,430
The first step for our environment setup is to change it from Python free to Python too.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,700
We are doing this because it has a flow data validation is more suited for Python to to change our environment.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,030
Go to edit and then notebook settings in there.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,690
You will have an option to change your runtime type.

11
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,610
It is currently selected to be Python free.

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,140
Just select Python two instead under a hardware accelerator.

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,740
You can leave it at none but if you want faster performance change to keep you after your media changes

14
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,680
click on save.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,560
It is going to initialize our environment and it's ready to be used.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,750
Now that we have our environment set up it's time to install a few dependencies that we are going to

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,800
need.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,650
The first package is Python snappy.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,720
It is here to accelerate the performance of the tens of data validation package.

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,500
It is not necessary by all means but it is a good practice to install it will go for the first free

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:40,110
cell and type exclamation mark to use batch commands and then apt there get installed python dev for

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,890
Python development and then Python snappy after death.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,520
Execute a self okay.

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,230
Now that we have installed our Python snappy package it's time to install the offload data validation

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,430
package.

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,660
Position your cursor to the next free cell and type exclamation mark pip install dash queue and then

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,820
there's a flow data validation.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,880
Execute the cell that tells upload data validation package is now being installed for us it is going

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,740
to take some time to install it.

30
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,700
So I'll skip to the part when it's finished.

31
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,320
Welcome back.

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,690
Now we have everything installed of our dependencies for our project.

33
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,140
Don't worry about these two errors.

34
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,030
Everything will work in spite of them.

35
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:35,040
The last thing we have to do in this video is to import our data set to import the data set into Google

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,020
club click on the arrow here and go to files.

37
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,320
Here you will find the upload button.

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,810
The data set we will be using in the tens of extended sections tends to flow transform and tens flow

39
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,600
data validation sections is a specific data set for the air pollution of the city of Belgrade.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,990
We will provide a data set for you in the resources of both sections so click on upload button and select

41
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,520
the provided CSC which you previously downloaded and one selected click on open.

42
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,260
This is just a reminder for you.

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,870
Nothing to worry about so click Okay.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,210
Now we have the data set uploaded to our environment that's everything we have to do for this video

45
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,620
in the next one.

46
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,830
We will continue with our data validation project.

47
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,240
If you have any questions or comments so far please post them in the comments section.

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,670
Otherwise I'll assume the next tutorial.
