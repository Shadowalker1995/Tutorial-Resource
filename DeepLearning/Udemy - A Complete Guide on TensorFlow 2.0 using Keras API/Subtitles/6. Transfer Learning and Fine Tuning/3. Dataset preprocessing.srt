Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in the previous video.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:11,300
We started with our transfer learning project but installing all project dependencies and downloading

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,090
the data sets for dissection in this video we are going to unpack the data set and import all dependencies

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,500
for our project.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,280
Let's walk through all dependencies that we are going to need.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,370
The first one is ice.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,250
It is going to help us to work with folders locate files and work with parts since we have our data

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,810
set in the Zip format.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,570
We need to extract the data from it somehow.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:46,890
That's why we need to import the python library called zip file then we have the name pi library.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:55,910
As always we are going to use it for matrices and math functions a flow 2.0 our library of choice for

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,370
neural networks modelling.

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:05,980
Then we have our map Gottlieb which is here to visualize our images for example take the M is here to

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,310
visualize any progress in the project.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,110
It is very easy and cool to use.

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,360
And lastly we are importing from the tens of low carers that pre processing that image.

17
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,210
I know it's a long path.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:28,980
These image data generator we will use it to create automatic image pre processing pipeline at the bottom

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,580
of this cell.

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,670
We have these magic command for map Gottlieb.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,390
It will make sure that all visualizations stay inside a notebook file and after that we are just printing

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,700
out the version of tens of flow library.

23
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:52,280
The first coding task for this video is to unpack the data set let's specify the path to the data set.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,870
So right data set path is equal to quotes and in quotes right.

25
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:10,300
Since we are in the current directory just dot slash cats and dogs filter out zip and that is our path.

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:19,760
The first task is not now let's use our ZIP file library to unpack this file first let's specify the

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,570
object is equal to zip file dot zip file.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,300
In here we have to provide two arguments.

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,830
This zip file takes a file path that we have specified before and mode in what a way to open a file

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,840
is it for writing reading or is it just for appending something to it.

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,890
In this case we want to opening for reading so just specify are right.

32
00:02:51,890 --> 00:03:01,600
File equal to and let us copy the data set back and for the mode set it to r execute the cell and add

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,010
two more codes s

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,730
now let's extract and roofing from it.

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:16,420
This zip object has a method called extract all it takes a few arguments but the most important for

36
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,750
us is Beth by default.

37
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:28,060
This argument is not if we don't provide it it will extract everything to the current folder so we can

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,210
leave it to none.

39
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:38,010
But let us specify to this in the quote specified dot slash which means the current directory execute

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:47,500
a cell and now let's close our ZIP object with a method called Close execute the cell and we are ready

41
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,970
to go to the next step.

42
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,970
But before we jump to the next step let's check what we have extracted go to files and as you can see

43
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:05,740
we have one new folder called Cats Dogs filtered and that is the folder that we got by extracting everything

44
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,170
from our downloaded file.

45
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,550
If we go to that folder you have two sub folders and one python file this trade folder contains all

46
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,300
training images and they're separated in separate folders by class which is just what we want for our

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:30,000
image data generator that we are going to use and we have the same thing or same folder structure for

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,850
our validation dataset this adapter is not by one be use at all since we are implementing everything

49
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,990
from scratch to conclude our video.

50
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:49,320
Let us define all our dataset parts start by creating a data set path new and set it to the current

51
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,840
directory is always and cats and dogs filtered which is the new folder that we got in from this path.

52
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:05,120
We are going to derive two new paths one for training data and other one for validation right.

53
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:13,010
Trained they're equal to eyes dart path that drawing this drawing takes two arguments.

54
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:22,570
The first one is the base directory which is our data set path new and the second argument is some sub

55
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,130
folder for us just specify train for a validation path.

56
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:35,330
It's almost the same so copy the line for the train there and where we have the keyword train change

57
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,270
to validation and execute a cell with this we are done with our data set pre processing for now if we

58
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,000
have any questions or comments please post them in the comment section otherwise I'll see in the next

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,510
tutorial.
