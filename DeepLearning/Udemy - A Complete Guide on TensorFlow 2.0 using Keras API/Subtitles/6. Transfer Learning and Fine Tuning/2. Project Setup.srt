Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial in this section of the course.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,470
We are going to work on transfer learning and fine tuning project in the first video in this section.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,630
We discussed the what transfer learning is and from this with your own words we are going to apply that

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:26,300
knowledge in practice these cute cats and dogs are images from the dataset that we are going to use

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,740
in this section the dataset contains only two classes cats and dogs.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,580
At first glance the task may look very simple.

7
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:44,290
We as humans can quickly tell what a dog is and what the cat is but that is not that obvious for computers.

8
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:54,280
Both classes have very similar features eyes years for tails and even the environment is very similar

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,090
if we were to create the custom architecture for this task.

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:08,380
We wouldn't achieve more than let's say 75 maybe 80 percent and our goal is to pass 95 percent and get

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:15,220
almost state of the art results on this data set by using transfer learning technique alone.

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,820
Before we started with the project let's install all dependencies and set up our environment.

13
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,460
The first step as always is to set up our environment to use drip you instead of you to do that.

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,220
Go to edit notebook settings and here you can select your python version and hardware accelerator which

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,250
is exactly what we need.

16
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,280
Select the Jeep you from the menu and click save.

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,330
Now it's time to install all dependencies for the project.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,570
The first one is tensor flow 2.0 in the first free cell.

19
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,470
Right.

20
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,940
Exclamation mark.

21
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,290
Beep.

22
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,730
Install then the flow that should keep you.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,610
Equals equals to two point zero point zero point alpha zero okay.

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,180
Tens of low is installed.

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,820
There is one more library to install called TDM.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,680
It is most certainly already installed by default but to be more sure lets try to install it.

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,040
Right.

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Exclamation mark.

29
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,310
Beep install IDM.

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,400
And as we discussed it was already installed which is perfect.

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,720
The last thing for this video is to download the data set to our Google color environment this command

32
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,730
will be in the resources for this lesson so you don't have to learn by heart.

33
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,560
But let's explain some of these parts to know what's going on here.

34
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:54,560
The first part is w get this comment will go to a particular server and download the package to our

35
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,690
local computer then we have this.

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,900
Then we have this link which is the location where we can find the data set.

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,230
And lastly we have this dash O which is the way to specify the output folder where our data is going

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,970
to be saved.

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,360
I'll just specify these dot slash the file name.

40
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,410
This will save the file to the current directory and for the file name.

41
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,440
I've just copied the name from the link but you can name it whatever you want.

42
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,810
Execute a cell and it is already downloaded.

43
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,820
Let's go to files here.

44
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,140
You will have these cats and dogs zip file which will unpack in the next video if you have any questions

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,350
or comments please post them in the comments section.

46
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,300
Otherwise I'll see in the next tutorial.
