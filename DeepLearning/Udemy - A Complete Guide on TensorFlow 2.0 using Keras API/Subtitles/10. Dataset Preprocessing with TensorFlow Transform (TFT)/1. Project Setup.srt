Hello everyone and welcome to this biking tutorial.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:09,090
In this with you we are going to start with our dataset pre processing project for our.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,970
This section will be using tens of low transform which is a part of tens of flow extended technology

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:22,500
stack in the previous section we use denser flow data set validation which is also part of the terms

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,870
of flow extended technology stack.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,450
By then it was all about checking whether the data is correct or not.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:37,350
Now we'll focus on data sets pre processing and the final touches on the data before putting it through

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,970
our model to started with the project that we are going to install all dependencies that we are going

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:50,260
to need and to set up the environment as you remember in the last section we had to transfer from spider

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:57,430
free to Python two because then the flow extended stack is more supported and better suited for Python

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,030
2 and that is the case here as well.

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,680
To start with our environments set up.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:12,490
Let's go to edit and in notebook settings instead of Python free is our runtime choose Python 2 for

14
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,110
hardware accelerator.

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,850
You can leave it.

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:22,010
It's not but you can change it to dupe you for faster pre processing and computation after you made

17
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,720
your changes click on Save everything is initialized and the environment is ready to be used.

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,390
The next thing that we have to do in this video is to install all dependencies that we are going to

19
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,050
use for our dissection.

20
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:43,550
There is only one to be installed and that is tensor flow transform go to the first free cell and type

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,570
exclamation mark pip install.

22
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:54,560
There's a flow dash transform execute a cell and it is going to install and that will be it for this

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,030
with you.

24
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,360
We have everything up and running and we are ready to proceed to the next step.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,150
If you have any questions or comments so far please posit them in the comment section.

26
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,130
Otherwise I assume the next tutorial.
