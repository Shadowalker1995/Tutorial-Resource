00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello and welcome to this new section on artificial neural networks.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,440
We're going to learn how to build an artificial new network in terms of flow 2.0.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,750
And that's why I have here in front of me.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,900
A new notebook which was shared with you too so that you can follow it with me.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,960
And in the annual get a series of practical activities to practice your skills on building artificial

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,620
new networks with sense of low 2.0.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,180
All right.

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,260
And so as you can see well the first cell is the image of the data set.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,870
We're going to work on which is the fashion minced data set.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,200
That's a classic an artificial neural networks.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,160
And not only it is a classic but also it is used as a benchmark you know to test the power of your artificial

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,150
neural networks.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,150
You're going to see that at the end of this notebook.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,190
We will end up with a certain accuracy that we managed to obtain after training the artificial neural

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,550
network we'll build on this data set.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,530
And so you know you'll be able to compare this accuracy with other accuracies obtained through other

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,510
models and other architectures of new networks and you'll see how well you're doing and how much you

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,080
can improve.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,140
So let's do this.

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,110
But before we start with the first steps let me show you the original data set that is on Kaggle.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,350
That's why here I precisely the image source from Kaggle and the exact link is this one the fashion

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:33,150
in this data set which is a data set composed of of 70000 images of size 28 by 28 of different clothes.

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,270
And you actually have 10 different clothes.

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,630
The first one is a T-shirt.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:43,170
The second one is a trouser then a pullover a dress a coat a sandal a shirt sneaker bag and an ankle

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,780
boot.

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,230
And so you guess the challenge we're going to have to solve in this new section it is going to be of

28
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,690
course to build a new network that can recognize these objects.

29
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,190
So it will have to predict 10 classes which are these ones here.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,620
And of course it will have to predict them correctly and the accuracy will get.

31
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:08,130
The end is simply the number of correct predictions out of the total number of images in the test set

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,660
which is 10000 right because in total we have 70000 images including 60000 images in the training set

33
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,230
and 10000 images in the test.

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,630
And of course we'll train our artificial neural network on the training set after which we will evaluate

35
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,780
it on the test set and this accuracy that will get in the end will be of course computed out of the

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,200
ten thousand images of the test set.

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,850
All right and then if you want to know more well each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels which is a total

38
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,670
of seven hundred and eighty four pixels.

39
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,520
That's actually an important number because you know since we are now starting with the classic artificial

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,550
neural network and not yet a convolution on the one that worked well you know the input of your new

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,830
network will be of one dimension.

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,230
It's going to be a one day vector and that's why we will actually do a reshape you know we will reshape

43
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:10,160
the 2D images you know 28 by 28 into a single input vector of seven hundred and eighty four elements.

44
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,880
So that's important to know this number.

45
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,930
But nor is it we'll be reminded in the implementation.

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,380
I also remind that this is a practical course on sense of flow 2.0 and not really a theoretical course

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,440
where we learn about auditioning all networks.

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,180
So this theory an artificial neural networks is not provided in this section.

49
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,910
It is actually provided at the end of this course in the annex part.

50
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,420
For those of you who need a refresh on artificial new networks or even if you're very new to this you

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,550
know you can learn them and you should really if that's the case you know you should start with the

52
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,490
annex parts.

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,030
And so actually I was just reminding that indeed for an artificial new network well the input layer

54
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,540
is just one vector composed of a certain number of elements.

55
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,790
And in that case it's going to be 784 elements corresponding to the pixels.

56
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,850
All right then you have to know you know an image processing that each pixel is actually a single value

57
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:16,950
between 0 and 255 therefore you know our training set and test sets will have 785 columns each one corresponding

58
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:24,090
to each pixel of the images and the rows in the training and test sets will be the images you know each

59
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,180
row will correspond to an image and all the columns of this row will correspond to different pixels

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,680
of this image.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
Right.

62
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,050
OK.

63
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,320
So I think we got all the information we needed.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,970
And so now let's start let's start building our artificial new network and sense of flow 2.0.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,660
And the first step as usual is to install the dependencies you know if you want to execute the different

66
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,730
cells of this notebook.

67
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,850
Well I included everything from the installation to how you import it and all the rest of course.

68
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,200
So here as we said everything is already executed and I kept the outputs that we can see together.

69
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,280
But if you want to re execute things again and try for example other architectures of new networks.

70
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,920
Well you can directly re execute the cells here but here we already have the outputs.

71
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,270
Let's not do this.

72
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:22,170
That's once again what you get after installing tensor flow GP you 2.0 porno with this command so exactly

73
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:29,280
as in the previous section then in step two we simply bought the libraries and the dataset and so the

74
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,920
libraries that we need are known by.

75
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,470
You know that now tend to flow 2.0 works really well with numbers so we import it and we also import

76
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:44,020
daytime to get some time related info during the training then sense of flow of course and then tons

77
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,780
of flow that carries data sets.

78
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,490
And that's because it contains that fashion this dataset.

79
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:49,800
Right.

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,400
So it's actually from the data sets module of the caris library.

81
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,980
OK.

82
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,110
So that's it for the introduction and now in and next oil will begin the first code section which is

83
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,690
about data processing after which we'll start building our artificial new network.
