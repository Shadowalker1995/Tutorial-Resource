00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,850
Hello and welcome to the intuition tutorials for the artificial neural networks part of the course.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,750
Super excited to get these things started.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,820
And today we're going to find out how we're going to tackle this section.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,660
So in this section we will learn the following things.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,380
First of all we'll talk about the neurons.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,070
So there'll be a little bit of neuroscience and we'll find out a bit about how the human brain works

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,670
and why we're trying to replicate that.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,940
And we'll also see what the main building block of a neural network of the neuron looks like.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,680
Then in the next story we'll talk about the activation function and we'll look at a couple of examples

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,160
of activation functions that you could use in your neural networks.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:49,110
And we'll find out which ones of which one of them is the most commonly used one in neural networks

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,770
and in which layers you would rather use which functions.

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,370
Then we'll talk about how neural networks work.

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,960
So in contrast to what you would expect and what it was probably conveyed in other courses and tutorials

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,220
we're not going to go into the learning.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,740
We're actually going to go into the working of the neural networks first because that way by seeing

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,550
a neural network in action that will allow us to understand what we're aiming towards what our goal

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,670
is.

19
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,060
So here we'll look at an example of a neural network we're going to look at a very simplified a very

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,300
simplified hypothetical example of neural network working to predict housing prices for basically real

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,980
estate prices and by looking at that example will understand better exactly what we're aiming towards

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,000
and what we want to achieve in the end.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,500
And then we will move on to understanding how neural networks learn because that way we'll be more prepared

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,100
for what's coming.

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,950
Then we'll talk about gradient descent.

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,720
This is also part of neural networks learning and we'll understand how that algorithm is better than

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,640
just the brute force method that you might be intending or willing to take as a first resort a first

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,080
method that comes to mind.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,200
So we'll find out how great what the advantage of gradient descent are and then we'll talk about stochastic

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,100
gradient descent.

31
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,550
It's a it's a continuation of the gradient descent tutorial but it's an even better and even stronger

32
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,150
method and we'll find out exactly how it works.

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:33,000
And finally we'll wrap things up by mentioning the important things about back propagation and summarizing

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,370
everything in a step by step a set of instructions for running your artificial neural networks.

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,170
I hope this all sounds very exciting to you because I am very excited myself and I can't wait to get

36
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,880
started.

37
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,230
I look forward to seeing you on the first tutorial.

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,360
And until then enjoy deep learning.
