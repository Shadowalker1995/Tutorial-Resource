Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,270
In this section we are going to use tens of flow light library to convert any model to tens of low light

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,400
version of it so we can serve it on a mobile device either Android or IRS.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,390
Before we do anything else we need to set up our environment to use drip you instead of you.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,060
So let's do that.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,800
Go to edit then notable settings and instead of none under hardware acceleration choose GIP you and

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,880
click save now your environment is set up to use drip you the first and only library that we have to

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,310
install is tends to flow version one point thirteen.

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,030
You might ask yourself this causes men to be tends to flow too.

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,150
Why are we using this version 1 13.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,490
And it is fair and very good question.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,830
To answer that in terms of flow two they didn't make tens of flow light supported.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:06,890
At the moment it is very new a library and we are going to use that as flow light only to convert our

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:14,000
model but the model itself is written in the same way as we would use it in terms of flow to.

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,420
So once this library is upgraded to support has a flow 2.0 you won't need to change anything.

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,070
That's pretty much it.

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,840
And it is very straightforward and very useful.

18
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:33,530
Let's install our library type exclamation mark pip install and instead of installing a offload 2.0

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:44,390
right there's a flow that GPO and equal equal to one point thirteen point one execute a cell it is going

20
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,780
to take some time to install this library.

21
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,440
So for me I didn't have it installed before.

22
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,140
And once it's finish we are ready to go in the next video we are going to work on the data set pre processing

23
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,520
and for now if you have any questions or comments please pause them in the comments section otherwise

24
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,910
I'll see in the next tutorial.
