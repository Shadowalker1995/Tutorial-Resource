Hello everyone and welcome to this python tutorial.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,720
In this video we are going to import all product dependencies that we are going to use for this project

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,850
and perform data set pre processing steps before we define our model.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,310
The first library to import is tends to flow as always.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,060
This is our library of choice for building neural networks.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,910
The NUM by is library to work with matrices and mathematical operations.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:37,050
And lastly we have to import our dataset because this module of a course is more about how to convert

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,330
a train model and deploy it on mobile device.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,350
We are going to use the same model and same data set from the very beginning of this course which is

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,730
called fashion and execute a cell.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,720
Now it's time to perform data cell pre processing steps.

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,290
The first step as always is to improve the data set.

13
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:07,950
So let's do that by defining X train y train as the first output and the second one is X test y test

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,410
all of that is equal to fashion I must not load the data.

15
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,810
This function is going to track for the data set and if it's not downloaded it is going to download

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,920
it from us.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,820
Now that we have our data loaded it's time to perform some pre processing steps as always when we work

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,240
with images it is common to normalize them doing this it will accelerate the training process and it

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,250
will make much easier for a model to converge every pixel in an image is ranging from zero to two hundred

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,110
and fifty five.

21
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,760
We are going to divide all of them by the maximum value of a pixel which is two fifty five.

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:59,880
So let's do that X train is equal to x train divided by 255 dot you can add these dot but you don't

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:11,850
have to let's do the same thing for X test x test is equal to x test divided by 255 dot and before we

24
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,640
jump into reshaping step of the data set pre processing let's explain why we reshape the data set it

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:26,310
up so let's take the shape of X train as you can see it has sixty thousand images where each image is

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,560
in Matrix format twenty eight by twenty eight so standard the image in our case we are going to use

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,110
fully connected network that only accepts vectors and not matrices as inputs.

28
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:47,930
So having that architecture in our mind we need to reshape the data set to be in vector format right.

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,550
X train is equal to x strained out to reshape and here we have to specify a new shape of our data set

30
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,020
we are going to say minus one which is going to take all sixty thousand images and then write 28 times

31
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:13,070
twenty eight which is seven hundred eighty four we will do the same thing for X test so right x test

32
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,630
is equal to x test thought reshape minus one comma 28 times 28.

33
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:29,960
Execute or cell and our X train and x test are successfully reshaped to be sure let's recheck the shape

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:37,550
of X train and as you can see it has sixty thousand images and now they're in vector format of seven

35
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:44,540
hundred eighty four numbers and that's it for our dataset pre processing stage if you have any questions

36
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,670
or comments please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll see in the next tutorial.
