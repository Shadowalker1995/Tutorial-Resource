Hello everyone and welcome to this very exciting section throughout this section.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:14,250
We are going to create our own stock market trading agent with reinforcement learning strategies specifically

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,060
for that.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,280
We are going to use deep cue network.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,690
Our board will trade actions for us.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,960
It wont make millions of dollars but it will be mostly positive and just to mention this right the way

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,430
we don suggest using this algorithm with your own money trading with this algorithm is on your own risk.

8
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,230
So please be very cautious let's start by setting up our environment and installing all dependencies

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,190
for the project okay.

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,060
As we did before to set up the environment go to edit and notebook settings and here we can choose the

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,260
Python runtime and we can specify a hardware accelerator because the training process of the agent won't

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,660
be very easy.

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,870
We need to switch it to GPO for hardware accelerator.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:14,770
After doing that click save the next step is to install all dependencies that we are going to need luckily

15
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,210
there are only two libraries that we have to install so in the first free cell we are going to install

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,330
tens offload 2.0.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,600
To do that.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Right.

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,000
Exclamation mark pip install tens of flow Dash.

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:41,870
GP You equal equal to point zero point zero point alpha zero execute a cell now that we are down with

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,700
a tensor flow.

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,200
There is a one library left in most cases it is already installed so this will be just for our track

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,360
the library is called PANDAS data reader.

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:01,210
This library helps us to retrieve all stock market data directly to our environment.

25
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,050
It is very easy to use so to install it right.

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:14,800
Exclamation mark pip install pandas dash data reader and execute the cell and that's all what we have

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,780
to do in this video in the next video we'll start working on the model itself.

28
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,470
If you have any questions or comments so far please post them in the comments section otherwise I'll

29
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,580
see you in the next tutorial.
