The story about a start-up that I've recently launched called&nbsp;Scooby AI!</p><p><br></p><p>During the last few months, I talked to many of my Data Scientists friends and colleagues who were job searching, and found three problems they shared. </p><p><br></p><p>First, job searching takes a LOT of time. </p><p>Second, once you start, you can’t stop. Offers are changing all the time! </p><p>Third is failing to meet all job requirements. Often, it’s just one that’s missing! </p><p><br></p><p>To address these issues, I built Scooby AI - a personal assistant to help your job searching process. </p><p>Here’s how:</p><p> - You build a profile</p><p>. - Scooby AI searches for the best job positions for you.</p><p> - He delivers them biweekly to your inbox. </p><p>- If necessary, he also sends curated study materials to help you land that dream job! </p><p><br></p><p>He’s currently equipped to help <strong>Data Science</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> folks. Due to recent developments, all potential job positions are <strong>remote</strong>!</p><p>If you’re interested in testing Scooby AI, you can sign up here: <a href="https://scooby.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>https://scooby.ai</strong></a> </p><p>If you have any questions, ideas or want to chat, you can leave a comment, send me a message or an email: <a href="mailto:luka.anicin@gmail.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>luka.anicin@gmail.com</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p>Enjoy learning!</p>
