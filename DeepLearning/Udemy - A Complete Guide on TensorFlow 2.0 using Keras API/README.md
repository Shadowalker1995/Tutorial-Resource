#### **Description**

Welcome to Tensorflow 2.0!

TensorFlow 2.0 has just been released, and it introduced many features that simplify the model development and maintenance processes. From the educational side, it boosts people’s understanding by simplifying many complex concepts. From the industry point of view, models are much easier to understand, maintain, and develop.

Deep Learning is one of the fastest growing areas of Artificial Intelligence. In the past few years, we have proven that Deep Learning models, even the simplest ones, can solve very hard and complex tasks. Now, that the buzz-word period of Deep Learning has, partially, passed, people are releasing its power and potential for their product improvements.

The course is structured in a way to cover all topics from neural network modeling and training to put it in production.

In **Part 1** of the course, you will learn about the technology stack that we will use throughout the course **(Section 1**) and the TensorFlow 2.0 library basics and syntax (**Section 2**).

In **Part 2** of the course, we will dig into the exciting world of deep learning. Through this part of the course, you will implement several types of neural networks (Fully Connected Neural Network (**Section 3**), Convolutional Neural Network (**Section 4**), Recurrent Neural Network **(Section 5**)). At the end of this part, **Section 6**, you will learn and build their own Transfer Learning application that achieves state of the art (SOTA) results on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

After passing the part 2 of the course and ultimately learning how to implement neural networks, in **Part 3** of the course, you will learn how to make your own Stock Market trading bot using Reinforcement Learning, specifically Deep-Q Network.

**Part 4** is all about TensorFlow Extended (TFX). In this part of the course, you will learn how to work with data and create your own data pipelines for production. In **Section 8** we will check if the dataset has any anomalies using the TensorFlow Data Validation library and after learn how to check a dataset for anomalies, in **Section 9**, we will make our own data preprocessing pipeline using the TensorFlow Transform library.

In **Section 10** of the course, you will learn and create your own Fashion API using the Flask Python library and a pre-trained model. Throughout this section, you will get a better picture of how to send a request to a model over the internet. However, at this stage, the architecture around the model is not scalable to millions of request. Enter the **Section 11**. In this section of the course, you will learn how to improve solution from the previous section by using the TensorFlow Serving library. In a very easy way, you will learn and create your own Image Classification API that can support millions of requests per day!

These days it is becoming more and more popular to have a Deep Learning model inside an Android or iOS application, but neural networks require a lot of power and resources! That’s where the TensorFlow Lite library comes into play. In **Section 12** of the course, you will learn how to optimize and convert any neural network to be suitable for a mobile device.

To conclude with the learning process and the **Part 5** of the course, in **Section 13** you will learn how to distribute the training of any Neural Network to multiple GPUs or even Servers using the TensorFlow 2.0 library.
