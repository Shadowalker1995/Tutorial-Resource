<p>We completed this section by converting and optimizing the TensorFlow neural network for mobile devices using the TensorFlow Lite converter.</p><p><br></p><p>Neural Networks can be enormous and very computationally expensive, because of that most of architectures canâ€™t be executed on a mobile device. To overcome this problem, we have the TensorFlow Lite - library used to optimize models in multiple ways so we can execute them on a mobile device or any other embedded device.</p><p><br></p><p>In this section, we have completed the side that any Deep Learning engineer would do - write a model, train it, and optimize it for a mobile device. From this point on, there is a mobile app building and creating a serving infrastructure on the side of a mobile device.</p><p><br></p><p>To give you a full perspective - I am providing a few additional links that cover the mobile side as well. After passing through this section and these links, you will have a full picture on how to put a neural network on a mobile device, either Android or iOS.</p><p><br></p><p>1.
