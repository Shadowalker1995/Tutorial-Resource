00:05.410 --> 00:06.490
Welcome back everyone.

00:07.310 --> 00:10.330
So far we've learned how to work with text files of Python.

00:10.340 --> 00:14.170
Do some things like regular expressions as well as work of PDA files.

00:14.300 --> 00:19.620
But I wouldn't say that those processes that we've learned are really natural language processing.

00:19.640 --> 00:25.640
So what is an LP or natural language processing for a formal definition.

00:25.640 --> 00:26.960
According to Wikipedia.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.230
Natural Language Processing or an LP for short is an area of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

00:33.560 --> 00:36.690
concern of the interactions between computers and human.

00:36.740 --> 00:42.890
That is natural languages in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts

00:43.160 --> 00:44.620
of natural language data.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.230
Now to put this in more simple terms.

00:49.230 --> 00:54.390
Often when performing some sort of analysis usually have lots of data that's numerical and that's really

00:54.390 --> 00:54.870
convenient.

00:54.870 --> 01:00.540
Things like sales numbers physical measurements quantifiable categories and computers are already very

01:00.540 --> 01:03.830
good at handling direct numerical information.

01:03.930 --> 01:11.260
However what do we do with computers about actual natural language data that is text data as humans.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.410
It's really easy for us to tell that there is a plethora of information inside of a text document like

01:16.410 --> 01:22.200
a PDA file an e-mail a book there's lots of information that we can easily access because we're humans

01:22.260 --> 01:27.720
and we understand how to read that natural language but a computer needs specialized processing techniques

01:28.020 --> 01:34.410
in order to understand raw text data text data is highly unstructured and can also be in multiple languages

01:34.440 --> 01:35.610
not just English.

01:35.610 --> 01:38.930
However we'll only be dealing with English language in this course.

01:40.430 --> 01:45.440
Natural Language Processing attempts to use a variety of techniques in order to create some sort of

01:45.440 --> 01:47.950
structure out of raw text data.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.760
In this section of the course we're going to start actually discussing some of these basic techniques

01:52.910 --> 01:56.930
which is why we didn't really introduce this lecture of what is an LP until now.

01:56.930 --> 02:00.340
So these techniques are built into libraries such as spacey and LTE.

02:00.340 --> 02:07.930
K. some example use cases of natural language processing is taking a raw text email and classifying

02:07.930 --> 02:15.310
it as spam versus a legitimate email or taking a raw text movie review and actually grabbing the sentiment

02:15.330 --> 02:19.080
Alliss being able to tell if the review is positive or negative.

02:19.300 --> 02:23.770
And these are things we're actually going to do during the course and we can also do things like analyze

02:23.770 --> 02:29.260
trends from Britain customer feedback forums or even understand text commands such as when you're talking

02:29.260 --> 02:29.740
to your phone.

02:29.770 --> 02:35.050
You say something like Hey Google play this song or Hey Siri or hey Alexa that needs natural language

02:35.050 --> 02:40.030
processing in order to convert that text information to something the computer can understand.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.540
So natural language processing is constantly evolving.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.540
And great strides are made even every month here.

02:47.550 --> 02:52.620
We're going to focus on fundamental ideas that all state of the art techniques are based off of.

02:52.650 --> 02:56.370
So let's begin by learning about the basics of using the spacey library.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.820
Coming up next we'll talk about space basics.

02:58.830 --> 02:59.590
I'll see you there.
