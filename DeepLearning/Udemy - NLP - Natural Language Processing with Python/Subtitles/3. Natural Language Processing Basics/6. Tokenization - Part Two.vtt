00:05.420 --> 00:10.850
Welcome back in the previous lecture I mentioned that we can actually visualize tokenization with the

00:11.390 --> 00:14.690
built in display see that comes with Spacey.

00:14.990 --> 00:19.560
Let's go ahead and show you how it works by jumping back to the notebook or we left off last time.

00:19.570 --> 00:19.790
OK.

00:19.790 --> 00:22.080
Here we are at the notebook where we left off last time.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.940
Well we're going to do is say from Spacey import and we're going to say this.

00:27.950 --> 00:31.790
Blazey it's just a funny pun on display.

00:31.790 --> 00:34.850
So the Spacey is the actual built in visualizer.

00:34.850 --> 00:36.050
It's really cool.

00:36.230 --> 00:41.240
And what's awesome is you can run it both inside the notebook if you're using Jupiter notebook or you

00:41.240 --> 00:46.680
can create a little server if you're running stuff outside of Jupiter using just the normal Python script.

00:46.790 --> 00:56.320
First let's create a document that we want to visualize will say a.p and then say Apple is going to

00:56.320 --> 01:06.180
build a UK factory for and let's do six million.

01:06.310 --> 01:12.170
Now that we have that document the next we're going to call is displacer remember its display of facey

01:12.220 --> 01:17.280
there and then we're going to say render and then we pass in the documents.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.340
There's also different style parameters you can do.

01:20.350 --> 01:25.210
So I'll put in some defaults here and then we'll kind of look for the documentation to see what else

01:25.210 --> 01:26.440
we can provide.

01:26.440 --> 01:31.050
The one parameter we are going to make sure we say right now is because I'm using an open notebook also

01:31.120 --> 01:33.340
Jupiter is the true.

01:33.480 --> 01:41.880
And then there's an options dictionary comparison and I'll say distance is 110.

01:41.950 --> 01:46.510
So if you run that you should see inside of your notebook this display.

01:46.510 --> 01:51.470
So notice here we're able to see Apple is a proper noun is is a verb.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.460
And you can see also the syntactic display over here of the arrows.

01:57.460 --> 02:04.570
So again lots information that we're now able to show this optional distance argument is the distance

02:04.570 --> 02:05.590
between the tokens.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.470
So you can make this a little smaller.

02:08.470 --> 02:13.350
Let's go ahead to make it 50 and run that again and I can see everything is a lot closer together.

02:13.360 --> 02:18.830
So depending on how long your actual document is you may want to experiment with the size to make the

02:18.830 --> 02:21.160
distance larger or smaller.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.090
Now you can also visualize the entity recognizer.

02:24.340 --> 02:25.650
So let me show you how to do that.

02:25.900 --> 02:33.400
Let's create another document will say and LP Pasadena could string saying something like over the last

02:33.400 --> 02:34.550
quarter.

02:35.200 --> 02:45.880
Apple sold nearly 20000 iPods for the profits of I don't know let's go ahead and they say $6 million

02:45.890 --> 02:46.320
again.

02:48.180 --> 02:48.960
There we go.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.770
So we have that string noticed that we have Flip's Let's make shall we say Apple correctly.

02:52.870 --> 02:57.740
Laura SPEEs So we have apples we have iPods we have 20000.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.680
And then we have six million.

02:59.890 --> 03:06.920
Let's go ahead and run that through display see the render pass in that document.

03:07.330 --> 03:10.570
But now for the style We're going to say E and T.

03:10.870 --> 03:14.910
So again the original style was the eppi for syntactic dependency.

03:14.990 --> 03:23.060
Here we're saying E.A. for entity and since we're using Jupiter we'll say Jupiter is true.

03:23.150 --> 03:26.190
So run that and this is a different type of display.

03:26.360 --> 03:31.160
What it's going to do is it's going to attempt to find every entity that it can.

03:31.220 --> 03:34.020
Inside this document and it's going to highlight it.

03:34.040 --> 03:40.730
So over the last quarter and then so here we see the highlight and we also see the type of events titas.

03:40.750 --> 03:47.060
So the last quarter is that date Apple is an organization nearly 20000 that's some sort of cardinal

03:47.060 --> 03:48.510
entity i-Pods.

03:48.560 --> 03:53.510
It's smart enough to understand that that's a product and then a for profit of six million it understands

03:53.510 --> 03:54.270
its money.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.360
So Spacey is smart enough to do this all on its own which is really amazing.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.430
Finally if you are creating visualizations outside of Jupiter maybe you're just running this in some

04:05.630 --> 04:06.810
postscript.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.290
Let's show you an example of how you can work with that.

04:09.290 --> 04:14.310
You simply say a.p and we'll say this is a sentence

04:17.140 --> 04:24.370
you say display C and instead of saying render inside the notebook you can say serve and then pass in

04:24.370 --> 04:27.620
the document and then pass in whatever style you want.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.200
I'm going to pass on style as syntactic dependency.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.760
So if you read that you may get something that says hey your firewall is blocking it.

04:35.770 --> 04:43.410
Go ahead and allow access and then you'll notice it's serving on port 5000.

04:43.480 --> 04:56.860
So we're going to have to do is inside your browser you're going to go to 6:59 dot 0 0 1 Colan 5000.

04:56.910 --> 05:03.510
Essentially your local IP address at port five thousand if you're on that night should see here the

05:03.510 --> 05:05.670
actual visualization and this will work.

05:05.880 --> 05:11.070
Even if you're running a shop by a script so it would just run this code inside it that postscript and

05:11.070 --> 05:12.440
will report back that it's running.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.470
Essentially this little mini server with this visualization.

05:16.680 --> 05:21.360
And before we finished off this lecture I want to also talk about this options dictionary that we mentioned

05:21.360 --> 05:22.400
above here.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.490
So this option's dictionary it's basically a bunch of styling calls you can make.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.570
You can check out the link we have in the notebook for the documentation link on visualizing the dependencies

05:30.660 --> 05:35.970
so you can visualize the Pennsy parse or visualize and see the recognition and so on.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.060
There's a lot of options you can do here and you can do things like coloring.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.490
You can do background colors.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.150
You can do zoom in zoom out all that stuff.

05:44.310 --> 05:49.050
So essentially you have this options dictionary and you can provide the colors you want the different

05:49.050 --> 05:51.790
fonts you want the background color you want and so on.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.980
And here's a table of all the options you can provide for a list of even more options.

05:55.980 --> 06:00.500
You can check out this place the API documentation simply by clicking on this link.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.750
You can check out all these different options.

06:02.970 --> 06:03.630
OK.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.570
I hope you have fun.

06:04.620 --> 06:09.330
And I would encourage you to passen your own sentences or own strings and play around and see how you

06:09.330 --> 06:10.780
can visualize it.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.900
We'll see you at the next lecture where we talk about stemming.
