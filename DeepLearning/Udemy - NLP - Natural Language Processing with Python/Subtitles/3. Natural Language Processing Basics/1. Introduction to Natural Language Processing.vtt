Welcome everyone to this section on natural language processing Python basics the goals for this section

00:11.780 --> 00:16.100
are to set up Spacey and the language library that you need to download for Spacey.

00:16.340 --> 00:19.310
And we're going to understand some basic and OLP topics.

00:19.310 --> 00:26.960
That is tokenization stemming limitation Stoppard's and also using Spacey for vocabulary matching.

00:27.170 --> 00:31.490
We're going to have a few introductory lectures that discuss common libraries such as Teekay versus

00:31.490 --> 00:36.260
Spacey and why we're using both in this course as well as a general discussion of what natural language

00:36.260 --> 00:37.970
processing is in general.

00:37.970 --> 00:39.550
All right let's get started.

00:39.550 --> 00:40.610
I'll see at the next lecture.
