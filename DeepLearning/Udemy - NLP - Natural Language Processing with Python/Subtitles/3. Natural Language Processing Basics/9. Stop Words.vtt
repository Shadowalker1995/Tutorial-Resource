Welcome back everyone to this lecture on stop it's words like and the appear so frequently in text that

00:13.380 --> 00:18.720
they really don't require tagging as thoroughly as unique nouns verbs and modifiers.

00:18.810 --> 00:23.910
We call these words stop words and they can be filtered from the text to be processed.

00:23.910 --> 00:29.880
Spacey holds a built in list of some around hundred and five English Stop words so against upwards just

00:29.880 --> 00:33.850
the really common words that don't really give you any additional information.

00:34.050 --> 00:38.100
And sometimes they can actually hurt your natural language processing.

00:38.100 --> 00:42.780
So a really common use case when you're working with the pipeline in natural language processing is

00:42.780 --> 00:44.330
to remove stop words.

00:44.370 --> 00:49.500
So we're going to show you how to remove Stoppard's with Spacey and we'll also show you how to add in

00:49.500 --> 00:54.600
your own special stoppers in case maybe you're dealing with a unique dataset where you have an acronym

00:54.600 --> 00:57.960
that gets used too much and you want to add that as a stop word.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.330
So let's go ahead and show you how to do all that with Spacey.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.040
OK here I am at the notebook.

01:02.040 --> 01:07.590
I've imported Spacey and I have loaded up the English core web small language and what we can do here

01:07.920 --> 01:10.420
is directly off this and opii object.

01:10.500 --> 01:19.260
I can print out a.p dots defaults dot and then you can passen stop underscore words.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.660
And if you run that it's going to give you this set.

01:21.660 --> 01:27.860
So notice it's not a dictionary it's actually a set of all the Stoppard's that are built into spaces.

01:27.870 --> 01:32.940
So again these are really common stop words and really common English words that typically don't give

01:32.940 --> 01:34.960
you too much more information.

01:35.070 --> 01:43.300
So the length of the actual object if you look at the length of and all the defaults stop words is 300

01:43.300 --> 01:49.520
in five words and you can easily check if a word is a stop word by simply calling an LP vocab.

01:50.340 --> 01:56.070
So I can say a.p the vocab and then I can pasan any word I'm interested in.

01:56.100 --> 02:04.380
So for example let's use a really common word like is is going to return back this lexia object which

02:04.380 --> 02:05.860
carries a lot of information.

02:06.300 --> 02:13.140
And you can simply call is stop attribute and it's going to say true is is a stop word Let's go ahead

02:13.170 --> 02:16.800
Adam more unique word like mystery.

02:17.660 --> 02:18.350
Run that.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.360
And that's false.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.560
This is a unique enough word.

02:20.570 --> 02:21.560
It's not that common.

02:21.590 --> 02:23.660
So it is not a Stop word.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.190
Now there may be times when you wish to add a stop word to the default set.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.760
We just saw here above.

02:28.850 --> 02:35.120
Perhaps you're working with text data like text messages and you see a lot of people using BT W for.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.290
By the way.

02:36.290 --> 02:41.130
So maybe you want that to be considered a stop word for your particular dataset.

02:41.160 --> 02:51.500
So we can do this is all you need to do is call an LP defaults stop words and then you say ADD and you

02:51.560 --> 03:00.340
add in the stop where they are interested in such as PTW then the next step is to manually grab again

03:00.370 --> 03:11.380
an LP vocab passen be T.W. and say is underscore stop and set it equal to true.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.910
You can go ahead and run that.

03:13.030 --> 03:17.060
And if you actually check the length of an LP defaults.

03:17.110 --> 03:20.760
Stop words you'll notice it's now 3 0 6.

03:20.770 --> 03:27.370
So we went ahead and added beat W to our vocabulary of stop words and if you actually now check and

03:27.370 --> 03:34.960
LP vocab for W and you ask is it actually a stop or it's going to return back.

03:34.960 --> 03:41.320
True it is a Stop word or remember PTW was not in our original list here or original set of stop words.

03:41.680 --> 03:47.470
If you want to remove a stop word so maybe you see a stop word here that you actually want to take into

03:47.470 --> 03:54.010
account maybe via or someone or third These are actually important words to you and you wanted to remove

03:54.010 --> 03:55.190
them from the set.

03:55.300 --> 04:06.320
You apply a similar process we do hear you say LP defaults stop words and then you call remove any passing

04:06.330 --> 04:08.230
whatever word you want to remove.

04:08.340 --> 04:15.140
So maybe you want to remove beyond because that's technically a stop word in this original appear.

04:15.460 --> 04:20.530
So I want to remove beyond and then what you end up doing is you call vocab

04:23.290 --> 04:24.040
beyond.

04:24.130 --> 04:28.700
And you say is stop and you said equal to false.

04:28.730 --> 04:34.460
Essentially doing the reverse of what we just did for adding a stop word and now when you call in LP

04:34.460 --> 04:39.650
vocab and ask for beyond and you ask is it a stop word.

04:39.750 --> 04:43.130
It's going to return back false and that's really it.

04:43.130 --> 04:48.880
Now you should be able to access bases defaults of Stoppard's and add or remove stop words as needed.

04:48.890 --> 04:52.860
Coming up next we're going to talk about vocabulary and matching with Spacey.

04:52.970 --> 04:53.960
We'll see at the next lecture.
