00:05.630 --> 00:07.430
Welcome back everyone in this lecture.

00:07.430 --> 00:11.410
We're going to have a brief overview of the assessment for the topic modeling section.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.010
Let's go ahead and open up the topic modeling Assessment Project notebook.

00:15.350 --> 00:15.770
OK.

00:15.770 --> 00:20.630
Underneath the topic modeling folder you should be able to find the Assessment Project notebook as well

00:20.630 --> 00:25.430
as the Assessment Project solutions and going to overview the Assessment Project and in the next lecture

00:25.460 --> 00:27.860
we'll go over the solutions together.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.750
So the Assessment Project is a topic modeling Assessment Project.

00:31.830 --> 00:37.020
And for this category you're going to be working over 400000 questions from Quora.

00:37.020 --> 00:42.150
Quora is a question answer site where people can post questions and then crowdsource from the community

00:42.150 --> 00:43.070
for answers.

00:43.230 --> 00:48.810
And what we're going to do is to ask that these questions though actually have any labeled category.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.250
And if you're looking for the questions it's simply this Quora underscore questions thought see a tweet

00:53.250 --> 00:53.830
file.

00:54.060 --> 00:58.520
So essentially this is a list of questions that look something like this.

00:58.580 --> 01:04.860
So once asking What's step by step guide to invest in something mentally very lonely which one way to

01:04.860 --> 01:09.880
dissolve water quickly sugar cetera and you can see here that there's a wide variety of topics.

01:09.900 --> 01:15.030
And right now we only have the questions so maybe nice if we can build some sort of automated system

01:15.390 --> 01:21.690
that automatically tries to guess the topic of an incoming question and then we be able to put it in

01:21.690 --> 01:24.180
the correct location on the court Web site.

01:24.180 --> 01:28.770
So we're going to do the things that we did before import pantless read in the CSC file.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.250
You do some preprocessing.

01:30.300 --> 01:37.530
And for this particular project I want you to use non-negative matrix factorization if you want.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.280
You can also perform this with LDA.

01:40.410 --> 01:45.900
But because of the size of the data set it's quite a bit larger than the articles dataset.

01:45.960 --> 01:52.260
And since MF is faster than LDA we only expect you to use an MF for this project.

01:52.290 --> 01:58.740
Again it's optional if you want to use LDK but we only expect an MF so perform T.F. IDF vectorization

01:59.130 --> 02:01.930
explore the Maxy and mehndi parameters.

02:01.980 --> 02:06.210
There's no right or wrong parameters here but you can use the same ones we used in the lecture.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.450
You should get a sparse matrix that looks something like this.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.210
Again notice it's quite a bit larger than NPR.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.050
NPR it was around 12000 articles.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.350
Here we're dealing with hundred and four thousand questions.

02:16.350 --> 02:18.230
Granted the questions are shorter.

02:18.330 --> 02:24.150
So that has to do a little bit with the size difference but these There's way more questions and there

02:24.150 --> 02:27.170
are articles so this data is bigger.

02:27.390 --> 02:32.850
And then you can reform non-avian matrix factorization and you're going to ask for 20 expected components

02:32.940 --> 02:35.580
essentially try to find 20 topics here.

02:35.580 --> 02:41.070
And I also encourage you to use random state 42 so you can compare the same topics that we get to the

02:41.070 --> 02:46.050
ones you get and then print out the top 15 most common words for each of the 20 topics.

02:46.050 --> 02:49.120
So here are the various topics that I got with random state.

02:49.140 --> 02:55.410
You can see some of these are learning languages and books things on the election things on businesses

02:55.410 --> 03:04.050
countries Russia Pakistan things on movies songs job work engineering things on India looks like resolutions

03:04.080 --> 03:05.570
New Year's etc..

03:05.700 --> 03:07.770
So there's a bunch of different topics there.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.210
And then you're going to add a new column to the original court data frame that labels each question

03:12.390 --> 03:13.940
into one of the 20 topics.

03:13.980 --> 03:18.360
So you're going to perform from our original data frame that has a list of questions to something that

03:18.360 --> 03:21.930
looks like this some sort of topics and obviously if you want.

03:21.990 --> 03:26.100
You can add a you know topic name and map some sort of topic names.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.460
Each of these topics that's not really necessary because there's two main topics I would expect you

03:29.460 --> 03:31.190
to manually name them all.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.230
But again essentially at the end of the day we should have something that looks like this.

03:35.250 --> 03:35.910
All right.

03:35.970 --> 03:38.070
So best of luck with that assessment project.

03:38.130 --> 03:41.170
Coming up next we're going to show you the solutions.

03:41.180 --> 03:41.880
We'll see you there.
