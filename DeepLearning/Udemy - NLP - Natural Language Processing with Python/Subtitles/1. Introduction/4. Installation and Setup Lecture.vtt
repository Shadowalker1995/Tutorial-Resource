00:05.720 --> 00:10.900
Hello everyone and welcome to the course installation and set up lecture in this lecture room.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.350
The three main things.

00:12.540 --> 00:16.080
The first one is to show you how to download and install Anaconda.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.100
The second one is how to create a virtual environment using an environment file that we give you.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.010
And the third one is opening up that Jupiter notebook system as a quick note.

00:26.090 --> 00:30.970
If you're an advanced user and you're already familiar with some other development environment or I.T.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.870
please feel free to use it.

00:32.990 --> 00:37.760
There's no restriction on what ease you need to use all the Python code that we show in this course

00:37.800 --> 00:40.960
will work on any ID that can run regular Python.

00:40.970 --> 00:45.860
We do however recommend using our suggested environment including a Jupiter notebook and tools to avoid

00:45.890 --> 00:49.930
issues along the way as well as being able to directly interact with the code.

00:49.940 --> 00:51.480
Juber No because a great system.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.120
And if you haven't tried it out first I would encourage you to try it.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.280
But again please feel free to use any development environment you prefer.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.400
Also keep in mind this lecture has resource links.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.490
Make sure to download that.

01:03.610 --> 01:06.930
Why a mail file before starting this lecture.

01:07.070 --> 01:11.100
OK we're going to start off by showing you how to download and install Anaconda.

01:11.290 --> 01:16.570
Anaconda is a distribution of Python that includes a bunch of scientific libraries that is really useful

01:16.780 --> 01:18.910
especially for natural language processing.

01:18.910 --> 01:22.770
Go ahead and either google search Anaconda download or go to the link here.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.290
I'm going to head over to my browser and go to that link now.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.450
OK here I am.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.910
Anaconda dot com slash download.

01:28.930 --> 01:33.460
Keep in mind this web site does change its appearance from time to time so if it looks slightly different

01:33.460 --> 01:35.710
for you don't worry that's totally OK.

01:35.710 --> 01:41.950
Somewhere along this page you should see three download options one for Windows one for Mac OS and one

01:41.950 --> 01:42.910
for Linux.

01:42.940 --> 01:47.290
So right now I'm filming this on a Windows computer so you simply click on your operating system.

01:47.290 --> 01:51.970
You'll scroll down and it should give you two options one for Python 3 and one for Python to.

01:51.970 --> 01:56.790
Go ahead and download the graphical installer and the pending on what kind of Windows machine you have.

01:56.830 --> 01:59.510
You may need to download 32 bit instead of 64 bit.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.000
But if you're on a more or less modern machine it's more likely that you have a 64 bit.

02:04.150 --> 02:06.460
So go ahead and download that installer.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.260
If you're on Mac OS simply click Macalester and then download that installer.

02:10.510 --> 02:14.350
And if you're on Linux you're going to also have installer that you can download.

02:14.350 --> 02:19.540
Keep in mind once you've downloaded that file if you scroll down there is a link telling you how to

02:19.540 --> 02:20.820
install in a condo.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.250
I would highly recommend you check out that link.

02:23.260 --> 02:25.800
It changes the pending operating system you choose.

02:25.810 --> 02:30.110
Basically if you click on that link it'll take you to the documentation on how to install and there

02:30.120 --> 02:36.130
are specific step by step instructions for installing on Windows installing on Mac OS and installing

02:36.190 --> 02:37.180
on Linux.

02:37.180 --> 02:41.470
So essentially if you have any questions during the installation process there's written instructions

02:42.040 --> 02:46.790
detailing step by step how to install in a condo in Windows on your computer.

02:46.810 --> 02:52.840
Ok so I'm going to go ahead and download this file and then keep in mind locate where ever you actually

02:52.960 --> 02:55.540
have the graphical installer on your computer.

02:55.540 --> 03:02.230
Let's jump to me double clicking on that graphical installer Once you've installed that or once you've

03:02.230 --> 03:05.560
downloaded an installer it's time to actually install Anaconda.

03:05.590 --> 03:11.410
So a click open here this executable file that downloaded for me and then you'll have the Anaconda set

03:11.410 --> 03:12.360
up guy.

03:12.490 --> 03:16.670
You'll go ahead and click next agree to the license agreement.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.170
I would recommend just installing it for just me.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.270
Then hit next.

03:21.380 --> 03:24.770
Go ahead and select the default hit next.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.570
Then eventually you'll have the advanced installation options.

03:28.610 --> 03:30.160
There's two advanced options here.

03:30.170 --> 03:35.020
You'll notice that one of them says at Anaconda to my path environment variable.

03:35.060 --> 03:41.060
If you've already installed Python previously maybe you've already installed Python from Python or than

03:41.060 --> 03:46.220
actually highly recommend clicking and adding anaconda to my path environment variable.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.520
I know it says here that it's not recommended.

03:48.590 --> 03:53.930
But if you have previous versions of Python what ends up happening is when you download or install certain

03:53.930 --> 03:55.990
files your computer gets confused.

03:56.030 --> 04:01.730
As far as what's Python version it should use your previously installed Python or your anaconda one.

04:01.910 --> 04:06.410
So if you've already installed python in the past from Python the org then I highly recommend adding

04:06.470 --> 04:08.760
anaconda to your path environment variable.

04:08.780 --> 04:13.040
If this is your first installation of Annacone then python ever then it's actually not really necessary

04:13.040 --> 04:14.310
to do that.

04:14.370 --> 04:17.070
OK so once you're all done with that go ahead and click install.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.190
Alright once you then installing.

04:19.190 --> 04:22.390
We now need to download the libraries you use for this course.

04:22.550 --> 04:27.530
The Anaconda's installation has also installed the Anaconda prompt command line tool.

04:27.530 --> 04:30.740
We're going to be using the command line for the next few steps.

04:30.740 --> 04:36.000
Keep in mind if you're on Mac OS or Linux you can also use your terminal as the command line or if you're

04:36.020 --> 04:39.130
on Windows you should also be able to use your command prompt.

04:39.130 --> 04:39.870
All right.

04:40.220 --> 04:45.380
So for this next step we're going to do is we're going to both create and activate the virtual environment

04:45.410 --> 04:46.760
we provided for you.

04:46.760 --> 04:51.720
This virtual environment is essentially a simple text file of a bunch of libraries that download along

04:51.720 --> 04:53.710
with a specific version of the libraries.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.380
That way you're going to be using the same libraries we use when creating this course.

04:57.410 --> 05:02.800
So you shouldn't have any issues with typos or small syntax changes and this environment does this all

05:02.800 --> 05:08.080
for you automatically check out the resource links for this particular lecture and download the Y.M.

05:08.180 --> 05:09.110
file.

05:09.110 --> 05:12.990
Upon clicking that resource link you should see something that looks like this.

05:13.040 --> 05:19.180
It's essentially a Google rivaling with an p underscore course underscore envied that why M-L is a simple

05:19.180 --> 05:20.140
I.M. file.

05:20.150 --> 05:23.880
It's not going to preview you simply just need to click here on this download button.

05:25.190 --> 05:30.890
Ok so once you've downloaded that you must keep track of the location of the dot why a mail file you're

05:30.890 --> 05:33.510
going to need to know its location in order to use it.

05:33.800 --> 05:39.620
Let's now go to the command line search for Anaconda prompt on your computer and then get started with

05:39.620 --> 05:41.680
creating an activity in the environment.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.430
Jump over to my command line now.

05:43.760 --> 05:50.060
OK here I am and I'm going to search for Anaconda prompt on my computer and you should see the Anaconda

05:50.060 --> 05:50.410
prompt.

05:50.420 --> 05:55.700
Show up again if you're on Mac OS or Linux and you don't find the Anaconda prompt through a spotlight

05:55.700 --> 05:56.210
search.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.190
We can do is also use Terminal.

05:58.610 --> 06:04.200
If you're on Windows and you still don't see Anaconda prompt We should also be able to Taipan is CMT

06:04.380 --> 06:07.490
and just use the normal command prompt for our use case though.

06:07.550 --> 06:10.070
I'm going to use the annica the Anaconda prompt.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.860
So let's click on that and open it.

06:11.930 --> 06:18.080
OK so I opened up my anaconda prompt and right now I'm located under-sea users and then my username.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.970
Keep in mind that I must know the location of my thought why M-L file that I just downloaded from the

06:22.970 --> 06:23.450
link.

06:23.640 --> 06:30.380
So right behind that here we can see that underneath my downloads folder I have the LP underscore course

06:30.440 --> 06:32.870
underscore NVI that y m l.

06:33.080 --> 06:38.270
So I need a change directory and make sure I'm in the same directory as wherever this why all file.

06:38.270 --> 06:39.070
So you have two options.

06:39.080 --> 06:44.440
You can either change directory at the command line or simply move that y M-L file to wherever you're

06:44.450 --> 06:46.180
located in the command prompt.

06:46.340 --> 06:54.290
So I can either move that folder to under user of my username or I can see using the words or letters

06:54.350 --> 07:00.920
CD and then type out the file path that my mail file is and you should be able to have autocomplete

07:00.970 --> 07:04.310
so only to change directory or CD into Downloads.

07:04.550 --> 07:11.990
And then if I'm on Windows I can type Diyar and I should be able to confirm that my M-L file is there.

07:11.990 --> 07:18.230
If you are on Mac OS or Linux the command for listening everything is simply L S for list.

07:18.270 --> 07:20.790
All right now it's time to take that.

07:20.900 --> 07:25.550
Y m l file and then restore the environment from the dot.

07:25.550 --> 07:32.350
Why M-L file the command for doing this is simply Konda eat NVI space.

07:32.540 --> 07:41.720
Create space single dash F and then the name of the file which is an LP underscore course.

07:41.750 --> 07:45.680
Underscore E and V thought y and L.

07:45.680 --> 07:49.640
Now before I hit enter I want to show you two really common errors.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.980
The first error is to accidentally have a typo.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.770
So for example let's say I forgot one of these underscores and I tried running this.

07:58.910 --> 08:02.190
If you have a typo somewhere you're going to get this error.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.500
Can't process without a name.

08:04.550 --> 08:08.640
If you have the error please triple check that you do not have a typo.

08:08.930 --> 08:13.420
If you've confirmed that you don't have a typo then you may be in the wrong directory.

08:13.430 --> 08:19.280
So for example if I actually go back up the directory notice now I'm in the wrong directory.

08:19.280 --> 08:28.140
I'm no longer in downloads so if I were to try to run the command Konda ENVI create dashed F and even

08:28.140 --> 08:33.170
with the correct filename if I hit Enter I'm going to get the same error.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.410
This is a really common error and there's only two possibilities.

08:36.420 --> 08:42.750
Either you spelled the file name wrong or you are in the incorrect location and you're not in the same

08:42.750 --> 08:43.750
location as that.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.190
Y.M. file please.

08:45.270 --> 08:49.560
Triple check that in case you get this can't process without a name error.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.200
Again it's an easy fix.

08:51.270 --> 08:55.870
You simply need to be in the correct directory so will say CD to download.

08:56.060 --> 09:01.140
All right now that we've confirmed or in the same directory as it that why M-L file simply type out

09:01.140 --> 09:09.360
the command Konda space E and V space create space dasht F and then the name of the y m l file.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.990
If you're in the correct directory you should either be able to tab autocomplete.

09:12.990 --> 09:18.150
This last part if you're not able to tab autocomplete that then it's a good indication they are in the

09:18.150 --> 09:19.190
wrong directory.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.140
OK so I'm in the right directory.

09:21.180 --> 09:26.930
I haven't committed any typos so I'm going to hit enter and then you should see something pop up that

09:26.930 --> 09:30.060
it's solving the environment and getting the packages ready for you.

09:30.920 --> 09:36.250
So once you do that it's going to eventually hit you with the list of packages to be installed.

09:36.410 --> 09:40.280
It's going to be a pretty long list and that's going to ask you for a yes or no and you're going to

09:40.280 --> 09:41.130
type out why.

09:41.210 --> 09:42.140
Yes.

09:42.140 --> 09:42.630
All right.

09:42.680 --> 09:47.540
After you've installed everything you should see the actual commands to activate the environment.

09:47.690 --> 09:52.060
So you'll see something like activates it use this and then to deactivate the environment.

09:52.070 --> 09:52.720
Use that.

09:52.850 --> 09:58.100
So here are the commands conduct of a and b course Conda deactivate the commands may be slightly different

09:58.130 --> 10:00.160
depending on operating system we are using.

10:00.230 --> 10:04.050
If you are a Mac OS or Linux you may have the same source activate anyways.

10:04.130 --> 10:06.150
The command will tell you what to type out.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.500
So any time you want to run the environment you're going to have to activate it.

10:10.670 --> 10:16.380
So we're simply going to say Konda activates an old P underscore course.

10:16.630 --> 10:18.440
Enter any notice here on the left.

10:18.440 --> 10:24.590
Now it's telling you you are operating in the virtual environment and again you have to activate this

10:24.620 --> 10:26.990
before typing out the following.

10:27.240 --> 10:33.230
Jupiter space notebook and what this is going to do is going to start to put a notebook in whatever

10:33.230 --> 10:34.900
directory at the command line.

10:35.150 --> 10:38.840
And then from here you can work with our files that we've given you.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.740
So I'm going to enter

10:42.540 --> 10:48.660
and once you hit enter you should see a pop up with a token and your browser should actually automatically

10:48.690 --> 10:51.600
open to the Jupiter notebook page.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.360
So let's go ahead and go to that now.

10:53.550 --> 10:56.000
OK so here I am at Jupiter notebook.

10:56.130 --> 11:01.110
You notice I have that y M-L file because I ran this in the same folder under Downloads and then I see

11:01.170 --> 11:02.430
other downloads.

11:02.430 --> 11:09.370
So all you need to do is simply click new notebook and then you have a new notebook ready to go.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.130
So this is the environment we're going to be using.

11:11.140 --> 11:17.500
It's essentially just Python written in cells so you can say something like prints hello do shift enter

11:17.500 --> 11:21.810
together and then you get to see the actual output directly below.

11:21.820 --> 11:26.530
So I do encourage you to do is download the zip file that contains all the coarse notebooks and then

11:26.530 --> 11:30.230
simply unzip it to wherever you're going to be running Juber notebook.

11:30.280 --> 11:34.200
In this case I have have it in the actual downloads folder.

11:34.210 --> 11:34.720
All right.

11:34.870 --> 11:39.340
If you have any questions please search the Q&amp;A forums in case someone has posted a similar question.

11:39.430 --> 11:40.900
And check out the ific Q lecture.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.520
If you still can't find an answer post the question answer forums your question with as much detail

11:45.520 --> 11:49.180
and screenshots as possible and I will be happy to get you up and running.

11:49.180 --> 11:50.830
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
