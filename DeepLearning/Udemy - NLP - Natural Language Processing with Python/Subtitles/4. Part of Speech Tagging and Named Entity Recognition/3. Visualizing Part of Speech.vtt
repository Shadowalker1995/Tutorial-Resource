Welcome back to this lecture on visualizing parts of speech.

00:09.280 --> 00:13.930
We just saw how to extract parts of speech tax from tokens and obtain information about those parts

00:13.930 --> 00:15.150
of speech tags.

00:15.160 --> 00:19.930
Let's quickly review how to visualize parts of speech structure with the Speccy we've already seen this

00:19.930 --> 00:20.410
before.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.420
So this is really just a review lecture.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.890
Let's head over to the notebook to begin.

00:24.890 --> 00:29.750
You should import Spacey and also load the space English language dictionary.

00:29.830 --> 00:34.330
Then we're going to do is create our document.

00:34.630 --> 00:41.500
So let's go ahead and just say something like The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

00:44.210 --> 00:45.680
lazy thought.

00:45.950 --> 00:46.960
There we go.

00:47.010 --> 00:56.350
Now in order to display when you say from Spacey import this Blazey and then off this display See object

00:56.680 --> 01:02.790
we can call render we pass in the document we want to display and then we have to choose a style.

01:02.890 --> 01:08.030
And for visualizing parts of speech probably the best style to choose is DGP which is going to this

01:08.030 --> 01:12.730
place syntactic dependency but also show you the part of speech tags.

01:12.950 --> 01:17.110
And then since I'm using Jupiter I'm going to say Jupiter is true.

01:17.420 --> 01:22.470
And if you just run this inside of Jupiter You should see the visualization occur.

01:22.490 --> 01:24.310
So here you can see the speech tag.

01:24.320 --> 01:31.400
So Fox is a noun and we can also see the syntactic dependency so we can see a proposition and so on.

01:31.400 --> 01:31.960
OK.

01:32.210 --> 01:37.980
Now there's definitely options that you can actually use as modifiers for this rendering and what you

01:37.980 --> 01:45.600
do is you create an options dictionary will say options and the various options you can choose are the

01:45.600 --> 01:46.710
distance.

01:46.710 --> 01:52.170
So one of them as I mentioned is distance and you can edit that to create more distance between these

01:52.170 --> 01:54.470
words or less distance between them.

01:54.480 --> 02:01.380
You can also describe if you want it to be compact or not so spacey will attempt to make this as compact

02:01.380 --> 02:03.940
as possible depending on what distance you chose.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.130
So you can say compact and here you actually pass in a string.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.120
True.

02:09.810 --> 02:16.830
You can decide on a color for the actual text so you can say color and this can take in basic strings

02:16.860 --> 02:18.490
or hex codes for color.

02:18.900 --> 02:22.900
So you can say something like I want to text the color yellow.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.490
You can also say B.G. for the background color.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.950
So again you can take in a string code here like red or you can actually passen your own hex code.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.780
So if you do a hex code picker you should be able to kind of mix and match and choose whatever hex code

02:36.780 --> 02:37.270
you want.

02:37.270 --> 02:41.580
I'm going to put one in here that we have in the notes and then you can also choose the fonts.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.780
Keep in mind that every single font is going to be available.

02:43.800 --> 02:48.300
It should just be the ones that are available from the space documentation essentially General fonts

02:48.300 --> 02:49.870
that are available in your browser.

02:49.890 --> 02:53.030
So for example at times new roman and it provide times.

02:53.340 --> 03:00.200
So you can run that and then essentially it lets go ahead and copy and paste this render.

03:00.380 --> 03:04.740
And if you do shift tab here you should notice that there is an options parameter.

03:04.790 --> 03:12.020
So we're going to do is say options is equal to options and when you run that night you'll see the various

03:12.050 --> 03:18.290
options occur and Lotusphere we our distance but compact is going to compact down these curves to just

03:18.290 --> 03:19.290
be flat.

03:19.610 --> 03:24.050
So previously we had this kind of larger curves compact flattens them out hopefully make it a little

03:24.050 --> 03:26.210
more compact along that vertical axis.

03:26.210 --> 03:32.180
We can see the colors now yellow for the words we chose our own custom background color and then we

03:32.180 --> 03:34.210
also went with times new roman font.

03:34.310 --> 03:36.830
So that's how you can customize the appearance.

03:36.830 --> 03:44.030
Keep in mind if you're doing really large tax display see serve is meant to accept a single document

03:44.060 --> 03:48.490
or a list of documents since large texts are difficult to view and online.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.530
You may want to pass a list of span's.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.980
Instead let me show you what I mean by that.

03:53.090 --> 04:07.500
I'm going to say doc to is equal to an LP I will say this is a sentence this is another sentence.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.320
And then let's actually make this one longer.

04:09.320 --> 04:13.930
This is another sentence possibly longer than the other.

04:16.150 --> 04:23.590
And what we can do is we can create a list of spans so I can say span's is equal to and then casting

04:23.590 --> 04:27.900
as a list I'll take doc to call S E N T S.

04:27.970 --> 04:35.320
So I remember that actually GRABBE sentences automatically and then we're going to say the C and what

04:35.320 --> 04:43.820
we can do is we can say instead of render serve and then pass and the span's will again choose the style

04:43.820 --> 04:46.250
to be syntactic dependency style.

04:46.490 --> 04:49.500
And if you want you can pass an options or not.

04:49.730 --> 04:54.410
Now you don't need to pass and all the options you can do something simple like a distance parameter

04:54.530 --> 04:55.550
and so on.

04:55.550 --> 05:01.330
Keep in mind when we say serve it's actually going to serve and render this outside of the Jupiter note

05:01.340 --> 05:05.560
but since we're not saying Jupiter is equal to true so we're going to run this.

05:05.590 --> 05:08.070
They should see something like running on port 5000.

05:08.270 --> 05:16.630
So what you need to do is inside your browser you need to go to 6:59 point zero point zero point 1 and

05:16.630 --> 05:19.900
then say Colan 5000.

05:20.110 --> 05:25.290
So we're going to go ahead and copy this and then open up a new tab and paste that in.

05:25.370 --> 05:29.680
Hit enter and now you should see the various spans so you can say this is a sentence.

05:29.710 --> 05:32.510
And if you scroll down you'll see another spand right there.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.460
OK.

05:33.640 --> 05:39.590
So we just saw how to visualize inside the Jupiter notebook using this Blaikie render.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.950
And we also saw how to visualize outside the notebook using serve.

05:43.180 --> 05:47.450
And again the serving is going to serve on a port depending on how many times you're serving.

05:47.470 --> 05:52.300
This port might be slightly different in which case if it's serving on port five thousand one you would

05:52.300 --> 05:55.120
just do something like 5000 on here.

05:55.210 --> 05:55.800
OK.

05:55.900 --> 06:01.280
That's it for creating visualizations and the unable to visualize the parts of speech.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.140
Coming up next we're going to talk about names and city recognition.

06:04.150 --> 06:04.850
We'll see it there.
