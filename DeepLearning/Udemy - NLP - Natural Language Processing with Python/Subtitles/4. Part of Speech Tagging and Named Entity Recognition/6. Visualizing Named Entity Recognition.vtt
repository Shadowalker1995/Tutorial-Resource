Welcome back to this lecture on visualizing names and see recognition.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.670
Let's review how to visualize any are with Spacey and the spicy.

00:13.740 --> 00:15.380
Let's head over to Jupiter notebook.

00:15.390 --> 00:21.540
OK here I am at a Jupiter notebook and I've imported Spacey as well as loaded up the English library

00:21.930 --> 00:24.540
and I said from Spacey import this Blazey.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.610
Next we're going to do is create a document that we actually want to visualize.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.400
We'll say.

00:31.860 --> 00:44.810
And here we're going to say over the last quarter Apple sold nearly 20000 units or let's say 20000 iPods

00:46.030 --> 00:50.740
for a profit of $6 million.

00:50.740 --> 00:59.140
Next we're going to do is after we define that document we'll call display see and we will render the

00:59.180 --> 01:03.600
doc and then Style say E.A. for entity.

01:03.900 --> 01:09.720
And since I'm using Jupiter I'm going to say Jupiter is true and he can see space to the best of its

01:09.720 --> 01:13.730
ability is going to highlight and color the Anstey's it finds.

01:13.730 --> 01:20.220
So find the date and see in organization money i-Pods his product cardinal for some sort of amount nearly

01:20.220 --> 01:22.150
20000 and so on.

01:22.170 --> 01:28.350
So you can see already the power that displace has to highlight entities.

01:28.350 --> 01:32.510
Now let's imagine you want to have multiple lines and you want to view them line by line.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.000
So for example we're going to create one more line inside of the documents.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.660
In fact we're going to pass in another string.

01:37.660 --> 01:42.560
So inside these princes go ahead and create a new stream and we'll say something like.

01:42.570 --> 01:53.560
By contrast Sony only sold well say eight thousand music players.

01:54.830 --> 01:56.370
And let's say Walkmen music players

01:59.490 --> 02:00.100
OK.

02:00.380 --> 02:05.570
So if you actually call read they're now in the documents it'll show everything as kind of one giant

02:05.570 --> 02:09.830
long string but maybe you only want to do this line by line the way you do that is just separate out

02:09.890 --> 02:17.890
into sentence segmentation by saying For sent in docked that sense and then you're going to call display

02:17.890 --> 02:26.710
C render individually on each of those by saying an LP sent that DXi pass and the text of each individual

02:26.710 --> 02:28.200
sentence segmentation.

02:28.390 --> 02:36.110
Again make sure you say style lips style is equal to E.A..

02:36.450 --> 02:41.730
And since I'm running this in Jupiter I will say Jupiter is true and you can see it gives you a little

02:41.730 --> 02:43.650
more spacing between the lines.

02:43.650 --> 02:48.590
It's not too different between rendering everything versus this.

02:48.620 --> 02:52.050
You can see that each new line is left in that TD instead of.

02:52.050 --> 02:55.150
By contrast is this essentially a continuation.

02:55.590 --> 02:56.220
OK.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.650
Now you can also have different options.

02:58.650 --> 03:00.570
Remember there's an options dictionary.

03:00.570 --> 03:05.910
You can actually choose options for things like coloring or customized effects and more importantly

03:06.000 --> 03:10.100
you can choose options to only display or highlight certain entities.

03:10.140 --> 03:17.460
So maybe you're only really interested in product entities where you can do is say options and under

03:18.090 --> 03:22.990
A.S. key you can pasan a list of what you're interested in.

03:23.010 --> 03:28.590
So maybe we're only interested in product entities then we're going to render this will render the whole

03:28.590 --> 03:37.960
thing recopy And this this and pace it down here and then we'll say options is equal to options.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.200
Run that and then it will only highlight the entities that you said here.

03:41.400 --> 03:46.280
And if you want to add another one like organization you simply just add to this list of options and

03:46.280 --> 03:47.660
then it's going to highlight that.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.220
So that way maybe you're not interested in it.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.180
Entities don't want those highlighted.

03:52.210 --> 03:55.000
You can easily filter out whatever you want.

03:55.090 --> 03:59.680
Then as always there's things like different colors so you can actually choose different colors for

03:59.680 --> 04:00.700
different entities.

04:00.700 --> 04:05.560
There's the default colors but if you really want to choose your own all you need to do is create an

04:05.800 --> 04:06.870
other dictionary.

04:07.880 --> 04:15.290
Called colors and then we're going to do is choose an entity and then you're going to pass in a color

04:15.290 --> 04:16.030
that you want.

04:16.070 --> 04:19.870
So for example you can say that you want this entity to be red.

04:19.970 --> 04:27.320
Then once you've done that you need to do is inside your options state a color is key and set equal

04:27.320 --> 04:31.040
to or set its value equal to this colour's dictionary.

04:31.070 --> 04:35.290
So if you run this you'll let us now that organizations have been read.

04:35.630 --> 04:41.000
And as always you can pass in your own custom hex codes in case you want a color that isn't simple.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.890
So for example I can pass on this hex code color and it'll create something that looks like that.

04:46.940 --> 04:53.410
You can also customize these even more so you can actually add linear gradients or radial gradients.

04:53.450 --> 04:58.740
So let me show you example of that X is going to copy and paste these from the notes we provide.

04:59.180 --> 05:01.730
So there's a radial gradient.

05:01.890 --> 05:07.520
See all you need to do is choose the tag and then say radial dash gradient and choose two colors either

05:07.520 --> 05:09.690
hex codes or string color codes.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.420
And if you run that what's going to happen is going to radial gradient.

05:13.490 --> 05:16.640
The inside is going to start yellow and then the outside is going to go to green.

05:16.640 --> 05:22.220
So for example we could say from yellow inside to outside red and you get something that looks like

05:22.220 --> 05:22.740
that.

05:22.940 --> 05:25.400
You can then also do a linear gradient.

05:25.460 --> 05:30.910
So you just called the linear gradient function and then choose a start middle and end color.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.400
Let me copy and paste that.

05:33.670 --> 05:39.430
So here we're going to choose linear ash gradient and you can choose an actual degree and then a start

05:39.550 --> 05:41.120
and stop color.

05:41.700 --> 05:47.660
So you can run that and it's going to start at kind of this darker purple and go to this pink again.

05:47.710 --> 05:49.800
You can just pass and string codes here if you want.

05:49.870 --> 05:54.040
You can say go from maybe orange red.

05:54.340 --> 05:59.320
Run that it can see it going from orange to red and you can change these to 180 degrees if you want

05:59.320 --> 06:05.440
it to go from top to bottom or so on or you can even choose if you really want like a 45 degree to have

06:05.440 --> 06:06.860
it go from one corner to the other.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.860
It's really up to you.

06:08.050 --> 06:12.790
Usually you won't need to customize color effects that often unless you have a very specific style that

06:12.790 --> 06:14.590
you're looking for.

06:14.590 --> 06:20.320
Finally we've showed you how to render everything inside of the Juber notebook but maybe you're running

06:20.320 --> 06:21.550
a dot PI script.

06:21.640 --> 06:29.330
As always you can simply call the splays see serve pass in the document passen style is equal to E.A..

06:29.560 --> 06:30.150
And if you want.

06:30.150 --> 06:36.110
You can still passen options and then notice I'm not saying you Brezik that true it's that I'm just

06:36.110 --> 06:37.040
saying this.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.310
And when you run that you should see it being served.

06:40.310 --> 06:45.920
So you just need to go to 6:59 point 0.01 at whatever port it's telling you.

06:45.920 --> 06:53.150
So in my case it's a port 5000 you copy and paste that and then you'll see the being rendered at that

06:53.150 --> 06:54.230
location.

06:54.230 --> 06:54.910
All right.

06:55.010 --> 06:59.780
So that's really it for rendering the most important thing to note here I believe is not really the

06:59.790 --> 07:05.840
coloring but the fact that you get to choose and filter based off what you want so you can always have

07:05.840 --> 07:09.510
this ants and then choose specific entities you want to highlight.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.060
Thinks elsea at the next lecture.
