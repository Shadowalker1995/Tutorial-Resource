Welcome everyone.

00:06.300 --> 00:11.010
It's now time to test your skills so we went over in the section of the course by going through an assessment

00:11.380 --> 00:15.480
and this lecture will have an overview of the assessment questions and the next lecture will go over

00:15.480 --> 00:16.550
the solutions.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.960
Let's get started by checking out the assessment notebook.

00:18.990 --> 00:21.690
OK here we have the assessment notebook for this assessment.

00:21.690 --> 00:25.740
We're going to be using a short story the tale of Peter Rabbit from 1982.

00:25.740 --> 00:30.900
It's in the public domain and we here we have a cell that you can run for standard imports such a Speccy.

00:30.930 --> 00:34.040
Loading up this library and importing displays.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.660
First we want you to create a doc file or dock object from the file.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.730
Peter Rabbit TSC it's nifty.

00:39.730 --> 00:41.280
Text Files folder.

00:41.280 --> 00:47.560
Then for every token in the third sentence print the token text the speech tag the fine grained tag

00:47.680 --> 00:51.540
and the description of the fine green tag and see if you can format it nicely so it looks something

00:51.540 --> 00:52.440
like this.

00:53.830 --> 00:58.950
Next we wanted to provide a frequency list of parts of speech tags from the entire document.

00:58.960 --> 01:07.370
So remember there's a way to actually count the frequency of each part of speech after that for a challenge.

01:07.380 --> 01:14.220
We asked what percentage of all the tokens are nouns and the id attribute for noun is 91 and you should

01:14.220 --> 01:16.020
get around 14 percent.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.790
The next task is to display the dependency parts for the third sentence.

01:20.910 --> 01:27.230
And really what that is is it's using display C to render with the style the E.P..

01:27.270 --> 01:29.910
So keep in mind this is not actually what it should look like.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.180
Instead he should be performing the visualization of it.

01:33.180 --> 01:38.380
Essentially that visualization for syntactic dependencies.

01:38.410 --> 01:43.360
Next we wanted to show the first two named entities from the Tale of Peter Rabbit.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.300
So what are those first two named entities.

01:45.340 --> 01:47.400
They should be these two the tale of Peter Rabbit.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.330
It's a work of art.

01:48.520 --> 01:53.620
And Beatrix Potter which is a person seven is how many sentences are actually contained in the Tale

01:53.620 --> 01:54.430
of Peter Rabbit.

01:54.430 --> 01:56.920
Remember we talked about sentence segmentation.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.440
And as a challenge how many sentences actually contained named entities.

02:01.750 --> 02:08.260
And another challenge problem is to display the named entity visualization for the indexed one list

02:08.260 --> 02:13.150
of sentences from the previous problem and it should look something like this a work of art a person

02:13.270 --> 02:14.300
and then a date.

02:14.350 --> 02:14.950
OK.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.340
Best of luck on the assessment.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.390
We're going to go over the solutions in the next lecture.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.000
We'll see either.
