Welcome everyone to the section on tax classification.

00:09.290 --> 00:14.690
Our goals for this section are to first understand the machine learning basics and understand classification

00:14.690 --> 00:15.200
metrics.

00:15.200 --> 00:20.210
Since we're going to need to understand how we can actually evaluate our tax classification models.

00:20.330 --> 00:25.460
After that we'll learn how to do things like text feature extraction and we'll familiarize ourselves

00:25.460 --> 00:31.280
with psychic learn in Python to perform tax classification on real datasets.

00:31.310 --> 00:35.810
Keep in mind we're gonna start off with quite a few quote unquote theory lectures and that means we're

00:35.810 --> 00:40.340
not going to be coding anything until we have a solid understanding of machine learning classification

00:40.490 --> 00:42.740
a text feature extraction concepts.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.180
So you'll see quite a few lectures first that are only slides before we actually jump into the python

00:47.180 --> 00:48.020
code.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.910
With that being said let's get started.
